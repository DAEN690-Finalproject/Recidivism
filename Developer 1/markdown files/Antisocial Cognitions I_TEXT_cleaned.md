Introduction: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is commonly associated with the risk of criminal recidivism.
Knowing more about the factors associated with this pattern of behaviour can help with the design of effective prevention stra-
tegies. The purpose of this article is to establish if there are differences in socio-criminogenic variables of a group of criminals
sentenced for the first time and with APSD compared to another group of first-time offenders who do not present this disorder.
Materials and methods: Analytical observation study of 70 men classified into 2 groups according to the presence of
ASPD TPA (n=47; age: 29.98±7.8 years) or absence of ASPD (n=23; age: 32.35±8.7 years).
results: The inmates with ASPD showed higher frequencies of current consumption of psychoactive substances (31.9%),
criminal associations and simultaneous use of psychoactive substances (70.2%), having committed the crime under the effects
of a psychoactive substance (55.3%), not having the possibility of distancing themselves from criminal associations (83%) and
a lack of legal resources for proceedings for defence and release (76.6%).
Discussion: This sample contains a group of variables called dynamic that are more commonly present amongst first time
offenders with ASPD; said variables have been associated as major predictors of recidivism. Given that they are regarded as
dynamic, they may well be modifiable.
