Abstract
A vast body of research underlies the ascendancy of criminogenic risk assessment, which
was developed to predict recidivism. It is unclear, however, whether the empirical evidence
supports its expansion across the criminal legal system. This meta-review thus attempts to
answer the following questions: 1) How well does criminogenic risk assessment differentiate
people who are at high risk of recidivism from those at low risk of recidivism? 2) How well
do researchers’ conclusions about (1) match the empirical evidence? 3) Does the empirical
evidence support the theory, policy, and practice recommendations that researchers make based
on their conclusions? A systematic literature search identified 39 meta-analyses and systematic
reviews that met inclusion criteria. Findings from these meta-analyses and systematic reviews
are summarized and synthesized, and their interpretations are critically assessed. We find that
criminogenic risk assessment’s predictive performance is based on inappropriate statistics, and
that conclusions about the evidence are inconsistent and often overstated. Three thematic areas
of inferential overreach are identified: contestable inferences from criminalization to criminality,
from prediction to explanation, and from prediction to intervention. We conclude by exploring
possible reasons for the mismatch between proponents’ conclusions and the evidence, and discuss
implications for policy and practice.

Introduction
Over the past 25 years, actuarial risk assessment of criminogenic risk factors has become
an “evidence-based” policy and practice in the criminal legal system, strongly promoted
within expert circles of policymakers, researchers, and practitioners (National Institute of
Corrections, 2010).1 Criminogenic risk assessment can be defined as (1) the use of statistical

methods to predict an individual’s legal system outcomes and categorize them accordingly,
purportedly to (2) manage carceral populations through efficient and effective allocation
of supervision resources and, ideally, to reduce individuals’ risk through appropriate
rehabilitative and social services.
The first part of this definition is about quantifying certain individual characteristics
associated with, and often thought to be generative of, illegal behavior. Four of these
individual characteristics (a history of antisocial behavior, antisocial personality pattern,
antisocial attitudes and cognitions, and antisocial associates), have been consistently
associated with recidivism, violence, and other legal system outcomes in almost any sample
of people involved in the criminal legal system (Dowden and Andrews, 1999; Gendreau et
al., 1996; Lipsey and Derzon, 1999). The second part of the definition is about intervening
on manipulable aspects of these predictors such as attitudes, cognitions, elements of
personality, and other “criminogenic” targets. Such efforts can modestly reduce recidivism
rates (Andrews et al., 1990; Andrews and Dowden, 2006).
A vast body of research underlies the ascendancy of criminogenic risk assessment. As a
result of its apparant success, it is moving from the back-end of the criminal legal system,
where it was developed to assess the risk of recidivism, to the front-end of the system, in
pre-trial processing, sentencing, and policing (Gottfredson and Moriarty, 2006; Lowenkamp
and Whetzel, 2009; Storey et al., 2014; Trujillo and Ross, 2008).
The relative success of this approach to risk assessment has been interpreted as evidence
that it taps into the causes of “criminal behavior” more generally, and that targeting these
factors can therefore also reduce illegal behavior and correctional supervision rates overall.
Indeed, an explanatory framework emerged around “the Big Four” antisocial criminogenic
risk factors as fundamental to the roots of crime itself, and a model for organizing and
applying this knowledge—the risk-need-responsivity model of correctional assessment and
rehabilitative programming—is widely accepted and promoted (Andrews and Bonta, 2010;
Bonta and Andrews, 2017; James, 2018; Serin and Lowenkamp, 2015).
Yet, with the field’s embrace and promotion of criminogenic risk assessment and the risk-
need-responsivity model, its advocates make expansive claims about what it can achieve.
Some proponents even argue that risk assessment should characterize the proper function
of the criminal legal system itself. For example, Andrews and Bonta (2010) suggest that
the prediction of illegal behavior is a central activity of the criminal legal system, because
“from it stems community safety, prevention, treatment, ethics, and justice.” In addition
to reducing recidivism rates, proponents suggest that the framework might be able to
improve sentencing procedures, facilitate jail diversion, reduce prison populations, help
scale down mass incarceration without jeopardizing public safety, and ultimately, prevent
crime altogether (Andrews et al., 2011; Clement et al., 2011; Monahan and Skeem, 2016).
The present meta-review interrogates the plausibility of such claims by attempting to answer
the following questions:
1Not all actuarial risk assessments focus on criminogenic risk factors, and not all criminogenic risk assessments are actuarial. This
meta-review, however, concerns the framework of actuarial criminogenic risk assessment.

1. How well does criminogenic risk assessment differentiate people who are at high
risk of recidivism from those at low risk of recidivism?
2. How well do researchers’ conclusions about (1) match the empirical evidence?
3. Does the empirical evidence support the theory, policy, and practice
recommendations that researchers make based on their conclusions?
To date, scores of meta-analyses and systematic reviews have attempted to answer the first
question, by synthesizing vast amounts of research on the predictive utility and validity of
criminogenic risk factors and particular risk assessment instruments. These reviews typically
conclude that the evidence supports the continued use and expansion of criminogenic risk
assessment.2 Concurrently, many critics have written about the scientific, cultural, and
political forces that brought risk assessment to the forefront in the era of mass incarceration
(e.g., Feeley and Simon, 1992; Garland, 2003), and on the ways in which risk may be
gendered and racialized (Hannah-Moffat, 1999, 2004). However, these critiques have not
always engaged directly with the empirical evidence thought to support criminogenic risk
assessment, instead challenging the framework’s premises outright.
This division of academic labor means that researchers who largely accept the premises of
criminogenic risk assessment have tended to oversee empirical research, its translation to
policy and practice, and assessments of its effectiveness. Critics, in turn, have tended to
question or dismiss the entire endeavor without directly engaging the empirical evidence on
which proponents base their claims. The present study bridges these worlds, approaching
the empirical basis of criminogenic risk assessment from a theoretical perspective more
skeptical than many of its current proponents.
Our purpose, in sum, is to evaluate whether what the field says about criminogenic risk
assessment is consistent with what the evidence says about criminogenic risk assessment.
We do this by conducting a meta-review of 39 meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the
predictive performance of criminogenic risk factors, with a focus on history of antisocial
behavior, antisocial attitudes and cognitions, antisocial personality, and antisocial peers.
Our goal is to provide a bird’s eye view of not only the empirical evidence surrounding
criminogenic risk assessment, but also how the field understands and interprets that
knowledge. This entails that we engage with the literature’s quantitative data and methods,
but also that we excavate its tacit theoretical and political assumptions.
A premise of our approach is that the way researchers mobilize concepts, language,
and methods to make claims about evidence and practice can reveal hidden ontological
and epistemological assumptions, and even contradictions. This is consequential if the
widespread acceptance and expansion of criminogenic risk assessment is predicated on the
misinterpretation or misuse of the concepts, terms, and methods associated with it. This, in
2One exception is a collection of meta-analyses and systematic reviews that casts doubt on criminogenic risk assessment’s
methodological rigor and predictive utility (Desmarais et al., 2016; Fazel et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2013; Singh and Fazel, 2010).
The force of this research, though, is (appropriately) directed at unpacking the first question above, with only cursory attention to the
second and third.

turn, can have a real impact on people’s lives, if scores generated from risk assessments
restrict people’s freedom or determine their access to health treatment or other services.
Moreover, we focus primarily on the empirical basis of criminogenic risk assessment, and
the field’s interpretation of it, rather than the merits of the risk-need-responsivity model,
because the former is prerequisite for certain aspects of the latter. Indeed, the originators of
the model acknowledge that criminogenic risk assessment was developed based on a “radical
empirical approach to building theoretical understanding” (Andrews & Bonta, 2010, p. 132).
Although they admit that this approach might be confused with “dustbowl empiricism”
(Andrews & Bonta, 2010, p. 133), they argue that it nonetheless “lead[s] to a deeper
theoretical appreciation of criminal conduct” and is “practically useful in decreasing the
human and social costs of crime” (Andrews & Bonta, 2010, p. 133). Moreover, while the
most recent iteration of the Risk-Need-Responsivity model de-emphasizes prior distinctions
between risk factors based on the antisociality construct and others (Bonta and Andrews,
2017), the influence of this psychopathological conceptualization of crime and criminality
—as something that emerges from within deviant or abnormal individuals, versus a social
relation—looms large, as we shall see below. This meta-review analyzes, assesses, and
critiques this logic.
Methods
To answer the three questions posed above, we conducted a systematic literature search
and review to identify meta-analyses and systematic reviews that examined the predictive
utility of criminogenic risk factors. (We will subsequently refer to the meta-analyses and
systematic reviews as “reviews,” while we will refer to the primary studies and data sources
that constituted those reviews as “primary studies.”) The details of our methods follow.
Inclusion criteria
Reviews were included if they were published in English language journals between 1990
and 2020, focused on a legal system outcome (e.g., recidivism or arrest), and focused
on male subjects. We excluded studies of criminogenic risk assessment among women
for several interrelated reasons. Sex does not appear to moderate associations between
criminogenic risk factors and criminal legal system outcomes (Singh and Fazel, 2010). Yet,
it was “…derived from statistical analyses of aggregate male correctional population data
and…based on male-derived theories of crime” (Hannah-Moffat, 2009: 211), and thus while
criminogenic risk assessment may appear to be “gender neutral,” it may nonetheless fail
to be gender-responsive (Hannah-Moffat, 2009, 2013). More recent efforts to incorporate
gender-informed variables into the criminogenic risk framework, however, may merely
reproduce gender-normative stereotypes and “neutralize gender politics and decontextualize
women’s experiences” (Hannah-Moffat, 2010: 201). While these issues are critical, they are
beyond the scope of the present review.

to isolate meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Titles and abstracts of retained reviews
were screened based on inclusion criteria to obtain a final sample.
Data extraction and analysis
Meta-data were compiled from the final sample of reviews. Citation information was
obtained from Web of Science and Google Scholar. Select characteristics of reviews were
tabulated. To answer the first question of this meta-review, we extracted and synthesized
quantitative results and researchers’ conclusions and interpretations. To answer the second
question, each author of the present meta-review independently rated review conclusions, to
determine whether reviews deemed the evidence for the predictive utility of criminogenic
risk assessment to be strong, moderate, or weak. Our inter-rater reliability, estimated with
Cohen’s kappa, was 0.84, p < 0.01. Ratings reflect consensus scores reached after discussing
disagreements. To answer the third question, we make claims based on a close reading of the
reviews, from which we identify and examine recurring issues with the concepts, language,
and methods mobilized by researchers in this body of work.
Results
Supplemental Figure 1 is a diagram of the flow of information through the meta-review
process. The initial search yielded 12,952 records. Articles were retained if their titles or
abstracts contained the terms meta-analysis or review. This reduced the number of records
to 561. Titles and abstracts of these 561 reviews were read to determine whether they met
inclusion criteria. The vast majority were excluded because they did not include a criminal
legal system outcome. Thirty-nine meta-analyses or systematic reviews were retained for
complete analysis.
Select review characteristics
Table 1 provides a description of retained reviews, and Supplemental Table 1 presents
selected information from each, including disaggregated data from Table 1.
Table 1 shows that the 39 reviews, two-thirds of which were meta-analyses, were published
in 25 unique sources. Criminal Justice and Behavior and Law and Human Behavior
published the most number of reviews (7 and 4 respectively). The vast majority of reviews
were peer-reviewed (N=36, or 92.3%). Those that were not peer reviewed appeared in books
or government-sponsored publications.
Collectively, reviews have been cited 7,553 times by other journals, according to Web of
Science or Google Scholar. While the plurality of reviews has been cited between one and
20 times, 52.1% of the total citations can be attributed to five high-impact reviews. The
plurality of reviews were published between 2011 and 2020.
Samples from primary studies in 84.5% of reviews were drawn from people who were
involved with the criminal legal system (either adult or juvenile “offenders”). The outcome
investigated by nearly all reviews was recidivism. However, definitions of this construct
were heterogeneous: types of recidivism often were not distinguished (i.e., re-arrest, re-

conviction, and technical violations were considered the same outcome), or a definition was
not provided.
Supplemental Table 1 shows that primary studies from the reviews cover a half-century,
from 1965–2020, and sample sizes (of combined participants from primary studies) ranged
from roughly 2,400 to nearly 140,000, though many reviews did not report this information.
Thirty-three of the 39 meta-analyses and systematic reviews were available in the Web
of Science database, which made it possible to conduct a bibliometric analysis of their
complete reference lists. The results of this analysis are presented in the second column
of Table 1, which shows the top 10 cited references and top 10 cited first authors.
Andrews (91 citations) and Bonta (33 citations), the creators and owners of the Level of
Services Inventory, and their students or frequent co-authors (e.g., Dowden, 11 citations and
Gendreau, 31 citations) were among the top-cited authors and were authors of the top-cited
references.
How well does criminogenic risk assessment differentiate people who are at high risk of
recidivism from those at low risk of recidivism?
Table 2 presents meta-analytic effect size estimates and other predictive performance
indicators from the sample of reviews for the four “antisocial” criminogenic risk factors
for recidivism. Most reviews reported findings in terms of either weighted point-biserial
correlation coefficients or Cohen’s d statistics, both of which were typically referred to as
“effect sizes.”
For studies that reported correlation coefficients, the range of mean effect size estimates
for history of antisocial behavior was 0.06 – 0.35, for antisocial attitudes 0.16 – 0.2,
for antisocial personality 0.18 – 0.31, and for antisocial peers 0.18 – 0.27. The range of
estimates for demographic characteristics such as sex, racialized group membership, and
education/employment status was 0.05 – 0.26. The magnitude of point-biserial correlations
are difficult to interpret because it depends on the coefficient itself and the prevalence of
the outcome (an issue we will discuss below). However, a heuristic is that coefficients of
0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 are small, medium, and large, respectively (Rice and Harris, 2005). Thus,
reviews tended to find small to medium effect sizes.
Also in Table 2, for studies that reported weighted mean Cohen’s d, the range of estimates
for history of antisocial behavior was 0.32 – 0.57, for antisocial attitudes 0.23 – 0.51, for
antisocial personality 0.42 – 0.6, and for antisocial peers 0.39 – 0.41. For demographic
characteristics, the range was 0.16 – 0.44. Cohen’s d is easier to interpret, as it does not
depend on the prevalence of the outcome. Cohen’s d can be interpreted as the proportion of
a standard deviation difference between two groups. Cohen’s heuristic for small, medium,
and large effects is 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8, respectively (Rice and Harris, 2005). Reviews reporting
Cohen’s d thus tended to find small to medium effect sizes.
Other meta-analyses reported weighted mean estimates for particular instruments overall.
Table 2 shows that the correlation coefficient effect size estimates for the Level of Services
Inventory ranged from 0.06 – 0.6, and for the Psychopathy Checklist, 0.26 – 0.28. Factor

2 of the Psychopathy Checklist, which measures antisocial characteristics, anger/aggression,
and impulsivity, had a stronger effect size (0.29 – 0.32) than Factor 1, which measures
callous, unemotional, and narcissistic traits (0.15 – 0.18).
A small number of meta-analyses calculated the mean area under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). This statistic represents the probability that a randomly
chosen individual who has recidivated would be ranked as having higher criminogenic risk
than a randomly chosen individual who had not recidivated. Schwalbe (2007), calculated
an ROC-AUC of 0.64 from a meta-analysis of 28 different risk assessment instrument
validation studies. Whittington and colleagues (2013) found a mean ROC-AUC of 0.69
from 65 studies. In a meta-analysis of 23 samples using the Level of Services Inventory
and the Psychopathy Checklist, Fazel and colleagues (2012) found a mean ROC-AUC
for recidivism of 0.66, a sensitivity of 0.4 (the probability that someone was assessed as
high-risk given that they recidivated), a specificity of 0.8 (the probability that someone was
assessed as low-risk given that they did not recidivate), a positive predictive value of 0.52
(the probability that someone will recidivate given that they were assessed as high-risk), and
a negative predictive value of 0.76 (the probability that someone will not recidivate given
that they were assessed as low-risk).
Eighteen of the reviews, or roughly 46%, tested for heterogeneity in meta-analytic results
as a function of study characteristics such as sample composition (male/female, white/
racialized group), study design (cross-sectional, longitudinal), source of risk assessment
coding (interview/files), publication status (published/unpublished), etc. In general, these
reviews found moderate to high degrees of heterogeneity that were attributable to the
above characteristics. Seven reviews, or roughly 18%, discussed the quality of their primary
studies. Four of these considered study design to be a proxy for quality, and as a result
two included only prospective, longitudinal designs (Bonta et al., 1998, 2014). Two assessed
whether design moderated meta-analytic results. One of these found that design had no
effect on results (Andrews and Dowden, 2006), and one found that prospective studies were
more likely to obtain statistically significant results than cross-sectional studies (Whittington
et al., 2013). One study found that coder-rated quality of the outcome variable was positively
associated with effect size (Lipsey and Derzon, 1999). Eight reviews mentioned publication
bias and 6 (15%) tested for it, and found that the likelihood of publication bias was low. This
is consistent with Singh and Fazel’s (2010) meta-review, which found that only a quarter
of reviews assessed for publication bias, which likely biases results in favor of positive
significant findings.
How well do conclusions about criminogenic risk assessment’s performance match the
empirical evidence?
Supplemental Table 2 paraphrases the primary conclusions of the reviews. Roughly 37% of
the reviews concluded that evidence for predictive performance was strong, 37% concluded
it was moderate, 13% concluded it was weak or that results should be interpreted cautiously,
and 13% did not draw explicit conclusions.
Thus, while over a third of the reviews judged the predictive performance of criminogenic
risk assessment to be weak to moderate, over a third of the reviews deemed it to be strong.

All but one meta-analysis drew these conclusions based on point-biserial correlations,
Cohen’s d, or ROC-AUC. The vast majority relied on the former two statistics, which do not
quantify predictive performance.
Measures of “effect” versus measures of prediction/classification.—Most
reviews used the language of “effect size” in describing point-biserial correlations or
Cohen’s d. This confuses and conflates the language and goals of causal inference with the
language and goals of prediction. Moreover, there are a number of major, well-understood
problems with the use of point-biserial correlations and Cohen’s d even as measures of
effect, including their dependence on the marginal distribution of the independent variable,
arbitrary features of study design, and sampling variability (e.g., Cumming, 2013, 2014;
Greenland et al., 1986).
But one issue in particular warrants further examination: the point-biserial correlation
coefficient depends on the prevalence of the outcome, which was frequently not reported
in the reviews or the primary studies that constituted them. Of greater concern is that
a large number of reviews made conversions among correlation coefficients, Cohen’s d,
and ROC-AUC, in order to implement meta-analytic procedures, using methods for this
conversion that are sensitive to outcome prevalence. However, these reviews rarely reported
the outcome prevalence estimates used in conversions or acknowledged that commonly cited
tabular conversion charts assume an outcome prevalence of 50%. Using a 50% prevalence,
or base rate, can overestimate the correlation coefficient if the true base rates are lower or
higher. This is relevant because a study of nearly 68,000 people released from prisons in
2005, randomly sampled to represent the roughly 401,000 people released from prisons that
year in 30 states, found that average recidivism rates are appreciably higher than 50% (Alper
et al., 2018). The proportion of people who were re-arrested within three, six, and nine years
of release was 68%, 79%, and 83% respectively (Alper et al., 2018).
Supplemental Figure 2 demonstrates the instability of point-biserial correlations converted
from Cohen’s d, as a function of outcome prevalence and the magnitude of d. This plot was
developed using the standard conversion formula from Rice and Harris (2005). For various
magnitudes of Cohen’s d (curved lines), an outcome prevalence (x-axis) of 50% results in
the maximum point-biserial r (y-axis). As outcome prevalence decreases or increases from
50%, the point-biserial r decreases. The potential for serious bias revealed in this figure—
that the true magnitudes of correlations are likely lower than reported in the reviews—has
been comprehensively discussed in the psychology literature (McGrath and Meyer, 2006).
Even if point-biserial correlation coefficients and Cohen’s d were described and interpreted
not as effects, but purely for prediction, they do not convey some important information
relevant to answering the first, technical question of this meta-review, about how well
criminogenic risk assessment differentiates people who are at high risk of recidivism from
those at low risk of recidivism. Only one meta-analysis (Fazel et al., 2012) presented
measures that provide this information: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and
negative predictive value. This review found that criminogenic risk assessments were better
at identifying people at low risk for recidivism than people at high risk for recidivism, i.e.,
negative predictive values were high. They argued, however, that positive predictive values

were unacceptably low: only 52% of individuals judged to be moderate to high risk went on
to commit any offense (virtually equivalent to flipping a coin).
Furthermore, one of the meta-analyses reviewed here found that the Receiver Operator
Characteristic curve was defined incorrectly in 27.8% of studies, and the Area Under the
Curve statistic was defined in only 34% of studies, and, when it was defined, the definition
was incorrect 37.5% percent of the time (Singh et al., 2013). Of greater concern, the
estimated Area Under the Curve values were only interpreted in one-third of the studies, and
was interpreted accurately in only 12.5% of these.
Thus, while empirical indicators provide relatively consistent magnitudes for the association
between criminogenic risk factors and recidivism, the most commonly used statistics do
not directly answer the first question regarding criminogenic risk assessment’s ability to
distinguish people at high vs. low risk of recidivism. And because the most common statistic
—the point-biserial correlation coefficient—is unstable relative to outcome prevalence, even
those measures were likely inflated: of the 17 reviews that presented correlation coefficients,
only three explicitly stated that they collected information about outcome prevalence from
their primary studies. Five others mentioned the issue of sensitivity to outcome prevalence,
but did not state whether they had information on true base rates from primary studies or
made assumptions about outcome prevalence. The one meta-analysis that reported positive
and negative predictive values found that risk assessments were good at correctly identifying
people at low risk of recidivism, but virtually no better than chance at identifying people
at high risk of recidivism. The technical performance of criminogenic risk assessment
has thus been interpreted inconsistently, and arguably inappropriately, by the framework’s
proponents.
Does the empirical evidence support the theory, policy, and practice recommendations
that researchers make based on their conclusions?
In this section, we analyze how the reviews talk about risk assessment and illegal behavior
more broadly, and assesses whether they make inferences that are supported by the data.
Three themes are identified: contestable inferences from criminalization to criminality,
contestable inferences from prediction to explanation, and contestable inferences from
prediction to intervention.
Contestable inferences from criminalization to criminality.—Reviews tended to
conflate exposure to the criminal legal system with illegal behavior. This occurred with
both the outcome (recidivism) and predictors (criminogenic risks). For the outcome, reviews
tended to conflate the causes of re-arrest, re-conviction, or the revocation of probation or
parole with the causes of recidivism resulting from new crimes. Indeed, 50% of reviews used
heterogeneous definitions of recidivism or did not report a definition of recidivism. There
are two broad categories of situation that can result in recidivism: new illegal offenses and
technical violations of the terms of community supervision, e.g., missing an appointment
with a parole officer. Most technical violations are not instances of illegal behavior (Council
of State Governments Justice Center, 2019), and there is often great discretion among
individual community corrections officers and agencies about which technical violations

are pursued (Jones and Kerbs, 2007). Thus, incident illegal behavior is sufficient but not
necessary for recidivism.
The heterogeneity of recidivism definitions reflects the heterogeneity among risk assessment
instruments used to predict recidivism. In their review, Desmarais and colleagues (2016)
found that of 19 risk assessment instruments validated in U.S. correctional settings, 31%
of validation studies defined recidivism as a new arrest, 13% as re-conviction, 10% as
reincarceration, and 4% as technical violations. Importantly, the definition of recidivism
influences the predictive performance of risk assessment instruments. For example, the
Level of Services Inventory was found to be a valid predictor of recidivism in roughly half
as many studies when the definition was re-arrest versus reincarceration (Vose et al., 2008).
Only two of the meta-analyses and systematic reviews acknowledged the difference between
exposure to the criminal legal system and illegal behavior. The remainder of the reviews
took for granted that legal system outcomes were the result of agential behaviors that
emerged from within deviant individuals (e.g., Bonta et al., 2014).
Recidivism can be the result of an individual’s own behaviors, the proclivities of their
supervision officer, or institutional policies and customs, and the causal mechanisms for
recidivism are not uniform across these scenarios. For example, impulsivity may be one
of many mechanisms for committing a new robbery, but family or employment problems
may be the mechanism for missing a mandated treatment session. And the disposition
of a community corrections officer might supersede both of these mechanisms in some
circumstances.
As Schwalbe (2008) notes in his review, none of this is important if the goal of criminogenic
risk assessment is purely prediction:
As statistical prediction devices, actuarial risk assessments do not assume an
underlying causal process related to recidivism. Rather, they count risk factors
irrespective of the specific factors that may or may not be present for an individual
case.
(pp. 1368–1369)
But for explaining crime or illegal behavior, and reducing risk, enumerating the correct
mechanisms of recidivism is paramount.
An analogous problem arises with criminogenic predictor constructs, which also conflate
illegal behavior with exposure to the criminal legal system. Only two reviews recognized
the conceptual and empirical distance between illegal behavior and exposure to the criminal
legal system, both within the context of racialized disparities. In the first, Wilson and
Gutierrez (2013) compared the predictive ability of the Level of Services Inventory among
Aboriginal versus non-Aboriginal “offenders” in Canada, and found effect modification
of Aboriginal status and risk score: high-risk Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals had the
same probability of recidivism, but low-risk Aboriginals had a higher probability of
recidivism than low-risk non-Aboriginals. The authors characterized this finding as an
“underclassification” of low-scoring Aboriginals. But a more critical interpretation is that

low-risk Aboriginals were subject to a lower threshold of policing, arrest, and sentencing,
i.e., they were victims of racialized discrimination. Similarly, in a review of studies that
compared risk assessments for ethnic minority and white offenders in the United Kingdom,
Raynor and Lewis (2011) found that ethnic minorities consistently had significantly lower
risk scores, but received the same sentences as higher-risk white offenders. The authors
attributed this finding to racialized discrimination in the British criminal legal system.
Findings such as these reveal that because crime is viewed as emerging from within deviant
or abnormal individuals, criminogenic risk assessments struggle to account for distortions
in the purported “signal” of individual differences that are in fact due to socio-structural
“noise.” In fact, whether or not a person will be re-arrested or re-convicted is influenced by
factors that have nothing to do with their criminogenic risk profiles, such as the way the
criminal legal system targets their racialized social position.
Indeed, criminogenic risk assessment avoids altogether basic questions about which
behaviors are considered crimes and whether behaviors that are deemed criminal are treated
differentially across time, space, and groups of people. Story (2016: 10) clarifies this
difference between criminality and criminalization:
While criminality is understood to be a state of objective deviance located in the
individual, to be criminalized is to be subjectified as well as subjugated by the
coercions of law enforcement and the criminal justice system, both of which are
highly malleable relative to changes in laws, policy, and institutional dictates….
The point is not that criminogenic risk instruments may contain racialized, gendered, or
other sorts of biases, but rather that, even if they do not, they may still perform unevenly
across groups if they attempt to map onto individuals the discriminatory operations of
the criminal legal system. Calibrating individual-level risk items for the sole purpose of
reducing the uneven performance of risk assessments across racialized groups, as Wilson
and Gutierrez (2013) suggest, without addressing structural and institutional sources of
discrimination and disparities, thus becomes a normative rather than technical solution.
While it might make risk assessments “perform better” in a predictive sense, such
recalibration would likely serve to mask, and reproduce, the structural and institutional
discrimination that caused the instrument’s underperformance in the first place.
Instead, most reviews implied that the question Why do some people engage in illegal
behavior more than others? is the same as the question Why does the criminal legal
system target some people more than others? This conflation was sometimes made rather
consciously:
The risk principle of case classification relates not to the retributive or deterrent
aspects of justice but to the objective of reduced reoffending through rehabilitative
programs. Let justice be done and let the just penalty be set, the just obligations
be established, and the just decisions be made. The risk principle of human service
becomes relevant when, in that just context, interest extends to public protection
through the delivery of human services.

In other words, advocates of criminogenic risk assessment take as a premise that the criminal
legal system is just. If there are unjust distortions, they are not the concern of criminogenic
risk assessment because they belong to the system as a whole. But if, in practice, risk
assessment reflexively reinscribes systemic injustice under a guise of scientific objectivity,
the intellectual and moral indifference implied by the above quotation becomes untenable.
Contestable inferences from prediction to explanation.—The outcome in nearly
all of the reviews was recidivism, and roughly 74% provided a definition of this outcome.
However, many reached conclusions that were not restricted to recidivism, but also to crime
or illegal behavior more broadly. As noted above and in Table 1, 58% of the reviews
drew on primary studies that had samples made up exclusively of juvenile and adult
“offenders.” Most of these discussed their theoretical orientation and findings in a way
that strongly suggested their results tapped into the origins of crime or illegal behavior, and
that predictors of recidivism might explain the onset and duration of illegal behavior. For
example (emphases added):
Bonta, Blais, and Wilson (2014):
GPCSL [General Personality and Cognitive Social Learning theory]
proposes that the causes of crime are to be found within the individual
and his/her social learning environment.
(p. 279)
Bonta, Law, and Hanson (1998)
The general findings of the current meta-analysis are consistent with broad
social psychological perspectives of criminal behavior.
(p. 138)
Olver, Stockdale, and Wormith (2014):
The Big Four and Central Eight underpin a general personality and cognitive
social learning theory of criminal behavior that provides an explanatory
model of the origin and continuation of criminal conduct, and informs
methods for predicting, reducing, managing, and preventing criminal
behavior.
(p. 157)
Olver, Stockdale, and Wormith (2009):
The LSI was developed from a general personality and social psychological
perspective of crime (Andrews & Bonta, 2003), embodied in the Big Four
covariates of criminal conduct—antisocial attitudes, antisocial associates,
antisocial personality, and a history of antisocial behavior (the constellation
is sometimes referred to as the Central Eight, with the inclusion of the
needs areas leisure and recreation, family and marital, substance abuse,
and employment and education). These covariates are linked to the origin
of criminal behavior (and are hence called criminogenic needs), and

services directed toward these areas of risk and need might reduce antisocial
behavior.
(p. 331)
These quotations show that many reviews motivated their analyses with a theory of crime
or theory of criminal behavior, although reviews focused on studies of recidivism, in which
individuals were already involved in the criminal legal system.
The problem with conflating the predictors, let alone causal explanations, for the onset of
illegal behavior or exposure to the legal system with causal explanations for recidivism
has long been recognized (e.g., asymmetric causation, Uggen and Piliavin, 1998). Yet,
few reviews dealt directly with the implications of generalizing from their legal system
sampling frames to individuals not involved in the system, and thus made the extension from
recidivism to “crime” or onset of illegal behavior without clear intention or justification. One
exception is a thoughtful explanation in Cottle and colleagues (Cottle et al., 2001), regarding
why their meta-analysis would focus only on recidivism and not initial offending:
It is not feasible to make meaningful assumptions about predictors of reoffending
behavior based on predictors found to be associated with first-time delinquency.…
…[S]tudies examining recidivism risk factors typically are based on more
homogenous samples of adolescents already identified as delinquent. Therefore,
variables significantly associated with reoffending behavior in juveniles are not
necessarily useful in initially distinguishing between adolescents who will or will
not become delinquents.
Nevertheless, slippage from what the evidence says about recidivism prediction to what
research says about the onset, duration, and origins of illegal behavior appears in nearly half
of the reviews analyzed here.
Contestable inferences from prediction to intervention.—Even if criminogenic
risk assessment correctly predicted recidivism, correct prediction does not imply effective
intervention; this is true even if predictive risk factors are manipulable (Greenland,
2005; Hernán and VanderWeele, 2011; Pearl, 2014). Accurately predicting the effects of
interventions is not possible without the identification of causal mechanisms (Schwartz
et al., 2016). Yet, proponents of criminogenic risk assessment switch from talking about
recidivism prediction to talking about recidivism reduction without directly engaging with
causation—their emphasis on manipulable risk factors merely assumes it. Below is a sample
of quotations that illustrate this question-begging (emphases added):
Bonta, Blais, and Wilson (2014):
The importance of these dynamic risk factors is that, in addition to being
predictive of criminal behavior, they can serve as targets for treatment
programming. Treatments that successfully address these dynamic risk
factors or criminogenic needs are associated with reduced recidivism

Changes in dynamic factors achieved through treatment that are
subsequently linked to reductions in recidivism are known as criminogenic
needs.
(p. 243)
Gendreau, Little, and Goggin (1996):
Moreover, the design of effective offender treatment programs is highly
dependent on knowledge of the predictors of recidivism (p. 575)…
Dynamic risk factors, or what Andrews and Bonta commonly refer to as
criminogenic needs (e.g., antisocial cognitions, values, and behaviors), are
mutable and thus serve as the appropriate targets for treatment
(p. 575)
Olver, Stockdale, and Wormith (2009):
Although the prediction of adult criminal recidivism is important and
interesting, some have argued (Douglas & Kropp, 2002), and we concur,
that the ultimate purpose of risk assessment should be the prevention as
opposed to the prediction of criminal recidivism.
(p. 346)
Vose, Cullen, and Smith (2008):
This theory argues that interventions should target for change empirically
established predictors of recidivism (such as antisocial peers, antisocial
attitudes, and antisocial personality. (p.23)…Given the fact that the LSI
includes a number of dynamic items, a reduction in an offender’s total
LSI score should occur after the offender has received treatment services
appropriate for his or her risk….
(p. 27)
Even if we granted that criminogenic risk assessment’s manipulable risk factors were
indeed causal, research evaluating correctional interventions suggests that these ostensibly
causal effects do not equal potential intervention effects. While a complete review of
the correctional intervention literature is beyond the scope of this analysis, it is worth
briefly noting that this literature does not clearly corroborate the causal assumptions in
the preceding quotations. Numerous analyses of the effectiveness of interventions that
target criminogenic risk factors to reduce recidivism tend to find small to moderate effects
and have not confirmed hypotheses about mechanisms of action (Andrews & Dowden,
2006; Lowenkamp et al., 2006). In fact, intervention effects are significantly larger when
programs are combined with other services, such as mental health counseling, employment
and vocational training, and educational programs (Landenberger and Lipsey, 2005). There
is very little evidence that recidivism reduction is achieved by reducing “antisocial”
criminogenic risk factors per se, rather than more general therapeutic and social service
outcomes combined with real improvements in the material conditions of people’s lives. The
assumptive transition, then, in many of the reviews analyzed here, from risk prediction to
risk reduction, is not supported by the data.

Discussion
We know a great deal about which individual-level factors are associated with recidivism.
However, criminogenic risk assessment 1) does a poor to modest job differentiating among
people at high versus low risk, 2) its predictive performance is often misinterpreted and
overstated, and 3) many inferences drawn from its empirical evidence base are not supported
by the data. Our findings suggest that we know comparatively little about criminogenic risk
assessment’s actual predictive performance, in terms of false positives, false negatives, and
other metrics derived from these measures. We know even less about how, and to what
effect, decisions about sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values are
implemented and evaluated in the field, only that these metrics are poorly understood by
researchers and practitioners in the rare cases they are even considered.
The slippage identified in the preceding sections suggests that the state of evidence does not
warrant claims that criminogenic risk assessment’s “theoretical and empirical base…should
be disseminated widely for purposes of enhanced crime prevention throughout the criminal
legal system and beyond….” (Andrews et al., 2011 emphasis added). Existing evidence
does not speak to its efficacy beyond tertiary prevention. In order for such claims to be
evidence-based, the methodological, definitional, and inferential problems discussed above
must be systematically addressed. A complete causal model that elaborates the structural-
and individual-level antecedents, confounders, and mediators of criminogenic risk factors
must be subjected to explicit hypothesis testing in appropriate samples.
One reason this has not already happened may be the radical empirical approach that
forms the foundation of criminogenic risk assessment. That is to say, because the theory
was developed to fit the data, rather than proposed a priori and subjected to empirical
confirmation, competing explanations were not subjected to rigorous hypothesis testing.
Other reasons may include prior theoretical commitments and a lack of attention to sample
construction and comparison groups. For example, Andrews and Bonta (2010, pp. 79, 93),
have argued that it is a “myth” that the “roots of crime are buried deep in structural
inequality.” They go on to cite the results of many of the meta-analyses reviewed here,
arguing that social factors such as socioeconomic status are demonstrably weaker predictors
of recidivism than criminogenic risk factors. Yet this does not appear to be the case: of the
nine studies that provided estimates for so-called “demographic” risk factors, roughly 56%
found “effect sizes” equal to or greater than the criminogenic risk factors. Table 2 shows
that demographic risk did not perform much worse (and sometimes performed better) than
antisocial characteristics in their association with recidivism. This is notable because we
would not expect a factor like socioeconomic status to be strongly associated with anything
in a sample where it does not vary appreciably, and the vast majority of people targeted by
mass criminalization and mass incarceration are low-income.
What might explain the mismatch between the empirical evidence and proponents’
conclusions about it?
Above we have suggested that many researchers seem to overstate the predictive utility
of criminogenic risk assessment in relation to the empirical evidence on which they base
their claims. One possible explanation for this mismatch is that the authors of these more

optimistic reviews may not be neutral arbiters of the studies they examine—both because
they are often also the authors of the studies they review, and because they have financial
interests in the instruments on which these studies are based. To explore this hypothesis, we
conducted a post-hoc bibliometric analysis of all references cited in our sample of reviews
with R package Bibliometrix (Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017), as well as a co-citation network
analysis of the reviews and their analyzed studies, using R package igraph (Csardi and
Nepusz, 2006).
For 35 of the 39 meta-analyses and systematic reviews, authors indicated which references
were analyzed as part of review procedures, or provided lists of these primary studies in
appendices or supplemental materials. We created a directed network of the relationships
between the reviews and their primary studies. Supplemental Figure 3 displays this network
in two layouts, with red nodes representing reviews that judged the predictive utility of
criminogenic risk factors to be strong, blue nodes representing reviews that judged it to
be weak, and grey nodes representing analyzed studies. The size of the grey nodes is
proportional to the number of reviews that cite them.
These networks suggest that there are two distinct clusters of reviews, each of which tends to
cite a group of primary studies that the other cluster mostly ignores, although there is some
overlap. Moreover, each cluster tends to correspond to a different ideological position about
the performance of criminogenic risk assessment: those reviews that deem the predictive
utility of criminogenic risk factors to be strong tend to co-cite a similar body of studies
that is distinct from the studies cited by the reviews that deem the predictive utility of
criminogenic risk factors to be weak.
What characterizes the cluster of reviews that are most bullish about the predictive utility of
criminogenic risk assessment? One key feature of this cluster of reviews is the involvement
of the developers of a particular risk instrument, or their students and frequent collaborators.
Andrews, Bonta, Dowden, Gendreau, and Wormith were authors on 73% of the reviews
that judged predictive performance to be strong. Three of the five most-cited reviews
(overall) included combinations of the Level of Service Inventory’s creators or their students
or co-authors.When we restrict the bibliometric sample to the reviews that involve these
authors, we find that 17 of the top 20 primary studies cited in those reviews were authored
or co-authored by Andrews, Bonta, Dowden, or Gendreau. This degree of self-citation
suggests a rather insular field that is largely self-refereed. Furthermore, Andrews, Bonta, and
Wormith have a proprietary interest in the Level of Services Inventory and receive royalties
on sales of the instrument from its publisher, Multi-Health Systems. Conflicts of interest
such as this were disclosed in only two of the nine reviews involving these authors.
Implications for policy and practice
In theory, risk assessment in the criminal legal system might productively be used to
focus resources on the people most in need of support and social institutions most in need
of change. But it is difficult to imagine how it might live up to this promise without
radical changes, from its conceptual underpinnings to its development, implementation, and
evaluation. At the very least, as the public begins to take greater notice of criminogenic risk
assessment, often opposing it on ethical as well as scientific grounds (Angwin et al., 2016;

Barry-Jester et al., 2015; Smith, 2016), it is incumbent upon researchers to be clear about
its scientific versus political content. This is because the perceived empirical superiority of
criminogenic risk assessment lends the appearance of scientific objectivity to the selection
and prioritization of risk factors, their scoring and weighting, and their tuning and revision,
belying the political and value-laden decisions inherent in all data generating and modeling
endeavors (O’Neil, 2016).
One way to address the theoretical and empirical overreach demonstrated above might
be to democratize and de-privatize criminogenic risk assessment. This would entail: (1)
making criminogenic risk assessment instruments open source and free; (2) providing open
access to scoring, coding, and statistical modeling procedures; (3) providing open access to
de-identified calibration and validation data; and (4) requiring jurisdictions to collect data
on, and report, false positives and false negatives.
There should be no profit motive (or paywall blocking access) to the design, dissemination,
and evaluation of risk assessments used to make claims about public safety, deprive people
of freedom, enable or remove their access to limited treatment and social service resources,
or otherwise limit or expand their life chances. In addition to transparency in the constitutive
components of risk, the way in which these items are prioritized, weighted, and scored
should be public and reproducible. Like certain data stored in the National Archive of
Criminal Justice Data, deidentified data collected by jurisdictions using criminogenic risk
assessments should be publicly available, with proper privacy protections. Jurisdictions
that use criminogenic risk assessments should be required to collect data on and report
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values on a
regular basis. While the calibration of these performance measures of course has technical
components, the moral and political dimensions of misclassification should be subject to the
same public dialogue that informs other jurisprudential and penal norms.
Limitations
The present meta-review is limited in the following ways: First, it is of course possible that
there was human error in implementing systematized procedures for screening reviews and
extracting data. However, our procedures were designed to minimize this risk. Second, the
primary aim of this meta-review was not to quantify a synthesis of findings across reviews,
but rather to conduct critical, narrative analysis. Thus, despite being firmly grounded in
quantitative methods, this review reflects the subjectivities, inherent biases, conceptual
orientation, and political and normative perspectives of the authors. Its findings should thus
be understood in that context. Finally, this meta-review is constrained by the methodological
deficits of its constituent reviews.
Conclusion
As the criminogenic risk assessment expands at the same time that the criminal legal system
slowly inches toward the precipice of reform, it is essential that we are clear about what the
evidence does and does not say, in order to resist the hubris of overreach and to prevent the
production or reproduction of harmful, unintended consequences. Targeted, strategic, and
