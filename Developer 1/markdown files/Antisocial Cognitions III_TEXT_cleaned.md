contributions to criminal behaviour (Andrews et al., 2006). A core feature of antisocial
cognition is criminal thinking which includes the attitudes and beliefs that are used to
rationaliseandjustifycriminalbehaviour.Gendreauetal.(1996)foundthatattitudes,values,
and behaviours that support a criminal lifestyle were individual predictors of recidivism.
Additionally,Walters(2012)conductedameta-analysisoncriminalthinkingandrecidivism
andfoundthatcriminalthinkingwasfoundtocorrelatewithrecidivism.Asantisocialcognition
hasbeenlinkedwithcriminalidentity(AndrewsandBonta,2010;Boduszeketal.,2012),itis
suggested that criminal identity may also serve to increase an individual’s likelihood of
recidivism.Antisocialassociateshavealsobeenfoundtobeastrongpredictorofreoffending,
and continued association with criminal friends after release from prison will increase an
individual’slikelihoodofre-entryintoprison(AndrewsandBonta,2010).
Criminological research has long investigated the extent to which personality traits are
associatedwithrepeatedcriminalengagement.Eysenck’stheoryofpersonalityisoneofthe
fewtheoriesofpersonalitythatexplicitlylinkspersonalitytocriminality;thusitwouldfollow
thatthemodelmayalsocontributetothepredictionofrecidivism.Accordingtothemodel,
the three basic dimensions of personality (psychoticism, extraversion and neuroticism –
PEN)arerelatedtophysiologicalmechanismsinthebrainandthecentralnervoussystem.
The theory suggests that through these neuropsychological processes (Eysenck and
Gudjonsson, 1989), delinquents should score high on the PEN dimensions. However,
supportforthetheoryremainsequivocal,andwhilesomeresearchhassupportedthemodel
(EysenckandGudjonsson,1989;Carrascoaetal.,2006;Savina,2009),othershavefailedto
find support for the model (Fonseca and Yule, 1995). Eysenck and Eysenck (1976)
investigatedjuvenilerecidivismandfoundthatnon-recidivistsscoredsignificantlyloweron
extraversion with no differences found on the other two dimensions. In a later study,
vanDametal.(2005)foundthatself-reportedrecidivismwasassociatedwiththePEN,but
psychoticismwastheonlypredictoroftheseverityofself-reportedrecidivism.
Additionally, demographic factors have also been identified as predictors of recidivism;
younger offenders (Bonta et al., 1998; Gendreau et al., 1996), those who are unmarried
(TheobaldandFarrington,2009)andthosewithlowlevelsofeducation(Nallyetal.,2012)
aremorelikelytoreoffend.Theaimofthecurrentstudyistoinvestigatetheextenttowhich
personality factors, antisocial associates and psycho-social criminal cognition (criminal
thinking and criminal social identity), place an individual at a higher risk for non-violent
recidivism while controlling for these demographic factors. Specifically, the study aims to
investigatetheroleofpersonalityasamoderatingintherelationshipbetweenpsycho-social
criminalcognitionandrecidivism.
Method
Participants
The sample consisted of 179 (n¼179) male non-violent offenders incarcerated in a high
security prison for recidivists. The offender sample consisted of 79 burglars and thieves,
25drugdealers,11addictedthieves,and64mixedoffenders.
The participants ranged in age from 21 to 66. The average age of the participants was
33.49 years (SD¼9.49). Most offenders (46.4 percent; n¼83) were from urban areas of
Poland(comparedtorural).Approximately51percent(n¼92)ofoffendersreportedtohave
attainedaprimaryschooleducationonly(comparedtoaboveprimaryeducation).Morethan
64percent(n¼115)ofprisonersindicatedtheirrelationshipstatusassingle(comparedto

from2to12times(M¼3.12;SD¼1.78)andthenumberofreportedpolicearrestsranged
from2to20(M¼4.30;SD¼3.44).
Measures
The Measure of Criminal Attitudes and Associates (MCAA) (Mills and Kroner, 1999) is a
two-partself-reportmeasureofcriminalthinkingstyleandassociationswithcriminalfriends.

Part B is a 46-item measure of criminal thinking style (criminal attitudes) including four
sub-scales: violence (12 items), entitlement (12 items), antisocial intent (12 items), and
associates(10items).Forthepurposeofthecurrentresearchonlythreesub-scales(violence,
entitlement, and antisocial intent) were considered in final analysis. Sample statements
included:‘‘It’sunderstandabletohitsomeonewhoinsultsyou’’(violence);‘‘Apersonisrightto

The measure of criminal social identity (Boduszek et al., 2012) is an eight-item measure
which was adopted and modified from Cameron’s (1999) social identity scale. The
instrument intends to measure prisoners’ criminal social identity. Each item was scored
onafive-pointLikertscale:1 – stronglydisagree,2 – disagree,3 – sometimes,4 – agree,
5 – strongly agree. Three items included in the scale were scored in a reverse direction
(i.e.stronglydisagree – 5andstronglyagree – 1).Possiblescoresrangedbetween8and
40,withhigherscoresindicatinghigherlevelofcriminalidentity.Themeasureincludedthree
sub-scales: in-group ties (three items) sub-scale measures the level of personal bonding
withothercriminals;cognitivecentrality(threeitems)sub-scalemeasuresthepsychological
salienceofacriminal’sgroupidentity;andin-groupaffect(twoitems)sub-scalemeasures
a criminal’s felt attitude toward other in-group criminals. Sample items for each aspect
of criminal social identity include: cognitive centrality (e.g. ‘‘I often think about being a
criminal’’);in-groupaffect(e.g.‘‘IngeneralI’mgladtobeapartofcriminalgroup’’);andin-
groupties(e.g.‘‘Ihavealotincommonwithotherpeoplewhocommittedacrime’’).

Results
The descriptive statistics and correlations are shown in Table I. All correlations between
predictor variables included in the regression models indicated that multicollinearity was
unlikelytobeaproblem(TabachnickandFidell,2007).
In the first step of sequential moderated multiple regression, the main effect of criminal
psycho-social cognitions (criminal thinking style and criminal social identity) on level of
recidivism was investigated while controlling for personality traits, criminal friend index,

The results suggested no direct relationship between criminal cognitions and recidivism.
The interactions between criminal thinking style and personality factors were statistically
significant,suggestingthattheeffectofcriminalthinkingonrecidivismdependsonthelevel
of psychoticism, extraversion and neuroticism. Simple slopes were investigated for low
(21 SD below the mean), medium (mean), and high (þ1 SD above the mean) levels of
personalityfactors(CohenandCohen,1983;Jaccardetal.,1990).Theresultsindicateda
positivesignificantassociationbetweencriminalthinkingstylesandrecidivismforprisoners
withhigherlevelsofpsychoticism(Figure1)andnegativesignificantassociationforhigher
levelsofextraversion(Figure2)andneuroticism(Figure3).
Intermsofmaineffects(model2),thestrongestpredictorofrecidivismwasnumberofpolice
arrests (b¼0.47), followed by criminal friend index (b¼0.22), and psychoticism
(b¼20.16).
Discussion
The aimof thecurrent studywasto investigatetheextenttowhich psycho-socialcriminal
cognition,criminalassociates,andpersonalityfactorsputanindividualatincreasedriskof
non-violent recidivism. The results suggest that criminal thinking alone does not predict
non-violent recidivism; however, the interaction between criminal thinking and personality
variableswaspredictiveofrecidivismwhencontrollingfordemographicvariables.Forthose
individualswhoscoredhighinpsychoticism,ahighlevelofcriminalthinkingwasassociated
withahigherriskofrecidivism.Conversely,apositiveassociationbetweencriminalthinking
and recidivism was only found for those respondents with low extraversion and
neuroticism scores; while for those respondents who scored high on extraversion and
neuroticism,ahigherlevelofcriminalthinkingwasassociatedwithalowerriskforrecidivism.

The interaction between personality factors and criminal identity were not found to be
significant predictors of recidivism. Thus, although criminal identity has been linked with
criminal thinking (Andrews and Bonta, 2010; Boduszek et al., 2012), the current research
suggestsitdoesnotservetoincreaseanindividual’slikelihoodofnon-violentrecidivism.
Additionally, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the findings suggest that the number of police
arrestswasthestrongestpredictorofrecidivism,followedbynumberofcriminalfriendsand
psychoticism. Association with criminal friends has long been identified as a significant
risk factor for recidivism (Andrews and Bonta, 2010; Gendreau et al., 1996). Although
psychoticism was foundto benegatively associatedwith recidivismalone,the interaction
betweenpsychoticismandcriminalthinkingstylewaspositivelyassociatedwithrecidivism.
ThecurrentfindingsdonotsupportEysenck’stheory,whichsuggestthatcriminalsshould
score high in three PEN dimensions. However, support for this theory is equivocal. The
current research suggest that psychoticism alone may reduce recidivism and it is only

throughitsinteractionwithadditionalriskfactorsthatitmayservetoincreaseanindividual’s
risk of re-offending. Furthermore, contrary to Eysenck’s theory, the relationship between
thinkingandbehaviourwasstrongestforthosewithlowextraversionandlowneuroticism.
The disparity in this finding may be due to the sample under investigation and Eysenck’s
theory,isperhapsmoreapplicabletospecificdelinquentpopulations.Thefindingthatthe
effectofcriminalthinkingstyleonrecidivismismoderatedthroughpersonalitytypeextends
the assertion of Andrews et al. (2006) who suggest that these factors are included in the
‘‘bigfour’’riskfactorsincriminality.However,incontrasttothesuggestionthatthesefactors
makeindependentcontributionstocriminalbehaviour,thecurrentresearchwouldsuggest,
intermsofnon-violentrecidivismatleast,itistheinteractionbetweenthesefactorsrather
than an independent contribution which predicts recidivism. Specifically, the presence of
criminal thinking will increase the risk of non-violent recidivism for individuals high in
psychoticismbutitwilldecreasetheriskforthosehighinextraversionorneuroticism.
Based on the current study, it is suggested that future research should look beyond the
independent predictors of recidivism to the interaction between risk factors. The current
study found this for non-violent recidivists, thus futureresearch could investigate whether
these interaction effects are also found for violent recidivists or antisocial behaviour in
general.Basedonthisresearch,risk/needsassessmentscouldthenbedesignedtoassess
themoderatingroleoneparticularriskfactorwouldhaveonanotherriskfactor.Inparticular,
personalitytraitsmayplayanimportantroleinmediatingtheimpactofadditionalriskfactors
for recidivism. This research also supports the inclusion of number of police arrests and
associationwithcriminalfriendsinanyriskassessmentinstruments.
In general, research attention and the development of risk assessment instruments has
tended to focus on violent or sexual recidivism; however, the overcrowding of our prison
systems by re-entrants and the effect of non-violent crime on society, indicates that the
prediction of general, non-violent crime warrants more research attention. The current
researchisnotableforitsprimaryfocusonnon-violentrecidivismanditsfindingsinterms

number of limitations that should be noted. The currents study relied on self-reported
