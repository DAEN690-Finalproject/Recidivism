Evidence Based – What does it mean?
There are different forms of evidence:
– The lowest form is anecdotal evidence; stories, opinions,
testimonials, case studies, etc - but it often makes us feel good
– The highest form is empirical evidence – research, data, results
from controlled studies, etc. - but sometimes it doesn’t make us
feel good
Evidence Based Practice is:
1. Easier to think of as Evidence Based Decision Making
2. Involves several steps and encourages the use of validated tools
and treatments.
3. Not just about the tools you have but also how you use them
Evidence-Based Decision Making Requires
1. Assessment information
- Valid and reliable offenders assessment process
- Assessment of programs and practices
2. Relevant research
- Consult research
- Design and fund programs that are based on empirical
evidence
- Use existing resources (i.e., Crimesolutions.gov)
3. Available programming
- To reduce risk
- Improve existing programs
- Develop new programs
Evidence-Based Decision Making Requires:
4. Evaluation
- Offenders
- Quality assurance processes
- Performance measures
- Data
5. Professionalism and knowledge from staff
- Understand EBP
- Trained, coached, and skilled
- Commitment
What does the Research tell us?
There is often a Misapplication of Research: “XXX
Study Says”
- the problem is if you believe every study we
wouldn’t eat anything (but we would drink a lot of
red wine!)
• Looking at one study can be a mistake
• Need to examine a body of research
• So, what does the body of knowledge about
correctional interventions tell us?
A Large Body of Research Has Indicated….
….that correctional services and interventions can be
effective in reducing recidivism for offenders, however, not
all programs are equally effective
• The most effective programs are based on some principles of
effective interventions
• Risk (Who)
• Need (What)
• Treatment aka Responsivity (How)
• Program Integrity (How Well)
Let’s Start with the Risk Principle
Risk refers to risk of reoffending and not the
seriousness of the offense.
Seriousness usually trumps risk.
Risk Principle
As a general rule treatment effects are stronger if we target higher
risk offenders, and harm can be done to low risk offenders

There are Three Elements to the
Risk Principle
1. Target those offenders with higher
probability of recidivism
2. Provide most intensive treatment to
higher risk offenders
3. Intensive treatment for lower risk
offender can increase recidivism
#1: Targeting Higher Risk Offenders
• It is important to understand that even with EBP there will
be failures.
• Even if you reduce recidivism rates you will still have high
percentage of failures
Example of Targeting Higher Risk
Offenders
• If you have 100 High risk offenders
about 60% will fail
• If you put them in well designed EBP for
sufficient duration you may reduce
failure rate to 40%
• If you have 100 low risk offenders about
10% will fail
• If you put them in same program failure
rate will be 20%
Targeting Higher Risk Offenders continued:
• In the end, who had the lower recidivism
rate?
• Mistake we make is comparing high risk
to low risk rather than look for treatment
effects
#2: Provide Most Intensive Interventions to Higher
Risk Offenders
The question is: What does more “intensive”
treatment mean in practice?
• Most studies show that the longer someone is in
treatment the great the effects, however:
• Effects tend to diminish if treatment goes too long
Results from a 2010 Study (Latessa,
Sperber, and Makarios) of 689 offenders
• 100-bed secure residential facility for adult male offenders
• Cognitive-behavioral treatment modality
• Average age 33
• 60% single, never married
• 43% less than high school education
• 80% moderate risk or higher
• 88% have probability of substance abuse per SASSI

Treatment. Criminal Justice and Behavior, 40(3).
Results from 2014 Study
• We expanded sample
• Hours examined by increments of 50
• Looked at low/moderate, moderate, and high

Study involving over 10,000 Youth
Latessa, Lovins, and Lux (2013). Evaluation of Ohio’s RECLAIM Programs. Center for Criminal Justice Research, University of Cincinnati
Provide Most Intensive Interventions to Higher Risk
Offenders
• Higher risk offenders will require much
higher dosage of treatment
– Rule of thumb: 100-150 hours for moderate risk
– 200+ hours for high risk
– 100 hours for high risk will have little effect
– Does not include work/school and other
activities that are not directly addressing
criminogenic risk factors
#3: Intensive Treatment for Low Risk Offenders will Often
Increase Failure Rates
• Low risk offenders will learn anti social behavior from
higher risk
• Disrupts pro-social networks
• Increased reporting/surveillance leads to more
violations/revocations

To understand the Need Principle we need
to review the body of knowledge related to
risk factors
What are the risk factors correlated with
criminal conduct?
Major Set of Risk/Need Factors
1. Antisocial/procriminal attitudes,
values, beliefs and cognitive-
emotional states
Cognitive Emotional States
• Rage
• Anger
• Defiance
• Criminal Identity
Anti-social/Pro-criminal Attitudes
• Views are supportive of a criminal lifestyle
• Explore rationalizations concerning their:
– Role
– Victims
– Behavior
– Friendships
– Substance use
Major set Risk/needs continued:
2. Procriminal associates and isolation from
prosocial others
Pro-criminal Associates
• Associates provide the context
• Associates act as role models
• Associates provide reinforcement
• Isolation from prosocial others increases risk
Reducing Negative Peer Associations

Restrict associates

Set and enforce curfews

Ban hangouts, etc.

Teach offender to recognize & avoid negative
influences (people, places, things)

Practice new skills (like being assertive instead of
passive)

Teach how to maintain relationships w/o getting
into trouble

Identify or develop positive associations: mentors,
family, friends, teachers, employer, etc.

Train family and friends to assist offender

Set goal of one new friend (positive association)
per month

Develop sober/prosocial leisure activities
Major set Risk/Needs continued:
3. Temperamental & anti social
personality pattern conducive to
criminal activity including:
– Weak Socialization
– Impulsivity
– Adventurous
– Pleasure seeking
– Restless Aggressive
– Egocentrism
– Below Average Verbal intelligence
– A Taste For Risk
– Weak Problem-Solving/lack of Coping & Self-Regulation
Skills
Major set of Risk/Need factors continued:
4. A history of antisocial behavior:
– Evident from a young age
– In a variety of settings
– Involving a number and variety of different acts
Major set of Risk/Needs Continued:
5. Family factors that include criminality and a variety of
psychological problems in the family of origin including:
– Low levels of affection, caring and cohesiveness
– Poor parental supervision and discipline practices
– Out right neglect and abuse
Major set of Risk/Needs continued:
6. Low levels of personal educational, vocational or
financial achievement
Leisure and/or recreation
7. Low levels of involvement in
prosocial leisure activities
–Allows for interaction with antisocial
peers
–Allows for offenders to have idle time
–Offenders replace prosocial behavior
with antisocial behavior
Substance Abuse
8. Abuse of alcohol and/or drugs
–It is illegal itself (drugs)
–Engages with antisocial others
–Impacts social skills
Mentally Disordered Offenders (MDOs)
Conventional Clinical Wisdom:
• Criminal activities of MDOs best explained by
psychopathological models
• Assessments typically focus on psychiatric
diagnoses, psychiatric symptomatology, and personal
distress (i.e. anxiety, depression)
• Assessments are often costly and time consuming
MDOs Continued
Review of the Empirical Research:
• The Psychopathological model has little relevance regarding the prediction of MDO criminal
behavior
• Gendreau (1996) conducted meta-analysis on studies of psychiatric symptomatology and
general recidivism: Correlation=ZERO
• Bonta’s (1998) meta analysis found correlation between having a diagnosed mental disorder,
mood disorder, or psychosis and general/violent recidivism ranged from r = .01 to -.17.
• Criminogenic risk factors were the strongest predictors (r=.23)
• Major correlates of criminal behavior appear to be the same regardless of presence or
absence of a mental disorder
Average Effect Size of Clinical Factors with General & Violent
Recidivism

Study by Bucklen and Zajac of parole
violators in Pennsylvania found a
number of criminogenic factors
related to failure*
Bucklen, B., & Zajac, G. (2009). But some of them don’t come back (to prison!): Resource deprivation and thinking
errors as determinants of parole success and failure. The Prison Journal. 89: 239–264.
Pennsylvania Parole Study
Social Network and Living Arrangements
Violators Were:
• More likely to hang around with individuals
with criminal backgrounds
• Less likely to live with a spouse
• Less likely to be in a stable supportive
relationship
• Less likely to identify someone in their life
who served in a mentoring capacity
Pennsylvania Parole Study
Employment & Financial Situation
Violators were:
• Less likely to have job stability
• Less likely to be satisfied with employment
• Less likely to take low end jobs and work up
• More likely to have negative attitudes toward employment
& unrealistic job expectations
• Less likely to have a bank account
• More likely to report that they were “barely making it” (yet
success group reported over double median debt)
Pennsylvania Parole Study
Alcohol or Drug Use
Violators were:
• More likely to report use of alcohol or
drugs while on parole (but no difference in
prior assessment of dependency problem)
• Poor management of stress was a primary
contributing factor to relapse
Pennsylvania Parole Study
Life on Parole - Violators were:
• Had poor problem solving or coping skills
• Did not anticipate long term consequences of behavior
• Failed to utilize resources to help themselves
• Acted impulsively to immediate situations
• Felt they were not in control
• More likely to maintain anti-social attitudes
• Viewed violations as an acceptable option to situation
• Maintained general lack of empathy
• Shifted blame or denied responsibility
• Had unrealistic expectations about what life would be like
outside of prison
Pennsylvania Parole Violator Study:
• Successes and failures did not differ in difficulty in finding
a place to live after release
• Successes & failures equally likely to report eventually
obtaining a job
Need Principle
By assessing and targeting criminogenic needs for change,
agencies can reduce the probability of recidivism
Criminogenic Non-Criminogenic
• Anti social attitudes
• Anxiety
• Anti social friends
• Low self esteem
• Substance abuse
• Creative abilities
• Lack of empathy
• Medical needs
• Impulsive behavior
• Physical conditioning
Some so called “theories” we have come across
• “Offenders lack creativity theory”
• “Offenders need to get back to nature theory”
• “Offenders need to change their diet theory”
• “Treat them as babies & dress them in diapers theory”
• “We just want them to be happy theory”
• “Male offenders need to get in touch with their feminine side theory”

Criminal Thinking and Mental Illness*
Morgan, Fisher, Duan, Mandracchia, and Murray (2010) studied 414 adult
offenders with mental illness (265 males, 149 females) and found:
• 66% had belief systems supportive of criminal life style (based on
Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking Scale (PICTS)
• When compare to other offender samples, male offenders with MI
scored similar or higher than non-mentally disordered offenders.
• On Criminal Sentiments Scale-Revised, 85% of men and 72% of
women with MI had antisocial attitudes, values and beliefs – which was
higher than incarcerated sample without MI.
See: Prevalence of Criminal Thinking among State Prison Inmates with Serious Mental Illness. Law and Human Behavior
34:324-336, and Center for Behavioral Health Services Criminal Justice Research Policy Brief, April 2010. Rutgers University.
Conclusion
• Criminal Thinking styles differentiate people who
commit crimes from those who do not
independent of mental illness
• Incarcerated persons with mental illness are
often mentally ill and criminal
• Needs to be treated as co-occurring problems
Criminal Thinking Among a Sample of
Incarcerated Youth with Serious Mental Illness*
Recently we replicated the Morgan et al study with a sample of 148
incarcerated male youth comparing those with serious mental illness
(N=37) to non mentally ill youth (N=111). We found:
• Youth with MI scored similar than non-mentally disordered youth
on both the Criminal Sentiments Scale-Revised and the Texas
Christian Criminal Thinking Scales
• This suggests that youth with serious mental illnesses have
attitudes and values of crime similar to those youth without
serious mental illness.
• Overall, there was no correlation between length of time incarcerated
and changes in scores
Assessment is the engine that drives effective
correctional programs
• Need to meet the risk and need principle
• Can help reduces bias
• Aids decision making
• Allows you to target dynamic risk factors and measure
change
• Best risk assessment method is the actuarial (statistical)
approach
To Understand Assessment it is
Important to Understand Types of Risk
Factors
Dynamic and Static Factors
• Static Factors are those factors that are
related to risk and do not change. Some
examples might be number of prior
offenses, whether an offender has ever
had a drug/alcohol problem.
• Dynamic factors relate to risk and can
change. Some examples are whether an
offender is currently unemployed or
currently has a drug/alcohol problem.
There are two types of dynamic risk factors
• Acute – Can change quickly
• Stable – Take longer to change
According to the American Heart Association, there are a
number of risk factors that increase your chances of a first
heart attack
 Family history of heart attacks
 Gender (males)
 Age (over 50)
 Inactive lifestyle
 Over weight
 High blood pressure
 Smoking
 High Cholesterol level
Best Assessments include both Static and
Dynamic Factors
• Just because we can’t change static factors doesn’t mean
they are not important
• Dynamic factors are often more difficult to measure, but
they are critical to developing case plans, prioritizing
targets for change and gauging progress
Some Examples of Offender Risk
Assessment Tools
• Level of Service Inventory (LSI)
• PCL
• COMPAS
• Ohio Risk Assessment System
The Treatment (Responsivity) Principle
• General
– Most people respond to programs that are based on cognitive
behavioral/social learning theories
• Specific
– People learn differently and have certain barriers that should be
addressed so that they are more likely to succeed in programs
Specific Responsivity
What gets in the way of benefiting from
treatment?
– Must take individual learning styles into
account
– Must consider possible barriers to
interventions
– Assessing and addressing responsivity
factors can be important to maximize
benefits of treatment
Responsivity areas to assess can
include:
• Motivation to change
• Anxiety/psychopathy
• Levels of psychological development
• Maturity
• Cognitive functioning
• Mental disorders
Prioritizing Interventions: What to Change and
Why
• Criminogenic targets – reduce risk for recidivism
• Non-criminogenic targets: may reduce barriers but NOT
risk
Treatment Principle
(general responsivity)
The most effective interventions are behavioral:
• Focus on current factors that influence
behavior
• Action oriented
• Staff follow “core correctional practices”

Most Effective Behavioral Models
• Structured social learning where new skills and behaviors
are modeled
• Family based approaches that train family on appropriate
techniques
• Cognitive behavioral approaches that target criminogenic
risk factors
Social Learning
Refers to several processes through which individuals
acquire attitudes, behavior, or knowledge from the persons
around them. Both modeling and instrumental conditioning
appear to play a role in such learning
Some Family Based Interventions
• Designed to train family on behavioral approaches
– Functional Family Therapy
– Multi-Systemic Therapy
– Teaching Family Model
– Strengthening Families Program
– Common Sense Parenting
– Parenting Wisely
Effectiveness of Family Based Intervention: Results from Meta
Analysis
• 38 primary studies with 53 effect tests
• Average reduction in recidivism= 21%

Meta-Analysis of Cognitive Behavioral Treatment for Offenders by
Landenberger & Lipsey
• Reviewed 58 studies:
19 random samples
23 matched samples
16 convenience samples
• Found that on average CBT reduced recidivism by 25%,
but the most effective configurations found more than
50% reductions

associated with effective treatment. Journal of Experimental Criminology. 1:451–476.
Significant Findings (effects were stronger if):
• Sessions per week (2 or more) - RISK
• Implementation monitored - FIDELITY
• Staff trained on CBT - FIDELITY
• Higher proportion of treatment completers -

• Higher risk offenders - RISK
• Higher if CBT is combined with other services -

• Was not related to number of days until the next violation
• Did not increase or decrease the number of subsequent
violations
• Receiving jail time as a sanction as opposed to a community-
based sanction did not influence successful completion of
supervision
Applying Core Correctional Practices
and Cognitive Behavioral
Interventions in Supervision and
Case Management
Examples are STICS, STARR & EPICS (Effective
Practices in Community Supervision
Traditional Officer-Offender Interactions are
often not Effective because:
 They are too brief to have an impact
 Conversations focus almost exclusively on monitoring
compliance conditions (and therefore emphasize external
controls on behavior rather than developing an internal rationale
for pro-social behavior)
 Relationship is often more confrontational and authoritarian in
nature than helpful
 What is targeted is not always based on assessment
 More areas discussed=less effective

Structure of EPICS Meeting
SESSION OVERVIEW
• Each session should be structured in the following way:
1. Check-In
2. Review
3. Intervention
4. Homework
96
Rationale for EPICS
Preliminary Data from Canada:

Trained officers had 12% higher retention rates in comparison
with untrained officers at six months.

Also found reductions in recidivism

We are Currently Piloting a New Version: Effective
Practices for Community Support (EPICS for Influencers)
• Designed to identify those people in the offender’s life that want to
help them stay out of trouble and train them on some of the core
skills taught in EPICS.
• Includes training of coaches to provide on-going support
?
Why EPICS for Influencers
• Build a pro-social network with some actual skills to help offenders avoid
risky situations
• Increase “dosage”
• Research shows that relapse prevention programs that trained significant
others and family members in cognitive-behavioral approaches were three
times as effective as programs that did not.
EPICS for Influencers is Designed for:
• Mentors
• Coaches
• Family Members
• Friends
• Faith Based Organizations
• Reentry Coalitions
• Law Enforcement
• School Officials
• Significant others
EPICS-I
• Pilot Sites include:
– LA County Jail Reentry Program
– Hamilton County (Cincinnati) Reentry Coalition
– Portsmouth, OH Juvenile Truancy and Mentoring Program
– Columbus, OH Halfway House
These approaches help us….
• Structure our interventions
• Teach and model new skills
• Allow offender to practice with graduated difficulty
• Reinforce the behavior
What Doesn’t Work with Offenders?
Lakota tribal wisdom says that when you discover you are riding a dead horse, the best strategy
is to dismount. However, in corrections, and in other affairs, we often try other strategies,
including the following:
• Buy a stronger whip.
• Change riders
• Say things like “This is the way we always have ridden this horse.”
• Appoint a committee to study the horse.
• Arrange to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses.
• Create a training session to increase our riding ability.
• Harness several dead horses together for increased speed.
• Declare that “No horse is too dead to beat.”
• Provide additional funding to increase the horse’s performance.
• Declare the horse is “better, faster, and cheaper” dead.
• Study alternative uses for dead horses.
• Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position.
Ineffective Approaches with Offenders
• Programs that cannot maintain fidelity
• Programs that target non-criminogenic needs
• Drug prevention classes focused on fear and other emotional
appeals
• Shaming offenders
• Drug education programs
• Non-directive, client centered approaches
• Bibliotherapy
• Talking cures
• Self-Help programs
• Vague unstructured rehabilitation programs
• “Punishing smarter” (boot camps, scared straight, etc.)
Fidelity Principle
Biggest Challenge: Making sure the program is delivered as
designed and with integrity:
• Ensure staff are modeling appropriate behavior, are qualified, well
trained, well supervision, etc.
• Make sure barriers are addressed but target criminogenic needs
• Make sure appropriate dosage of treatment is provided
• Monitor delivery of programs & activities, etc.
• Reassess offenders in meeting target behaviors

Some Lessons Learned from the
Research
 Who you put in a program is important – pay
attention to risk
 What you target is important – pay attention to
criminogenic needs
 How you target offender for change is important –
use behavioral approaches
 Program Integrity makes a difference - Service
delivery, training/supervision of staff, support for
program, QA, evaluation, etc.
