Are Education Programs in Prison Worth It? 
A meta-analysis of the highest-quality academic research  
By Steven Sprick Schuster and Ben Stickle 
(Editor’s note: This analysis was turned into an academic paper and published in the American Journal of Criminal Justice on Oct. 21, 2023. It is available here:

Introduction 
More than five in every 1,000 people in the U.S. 
population are behind bars, the sixth highest rate in 
the world, even though many other countries have 
higher violent crime rates.1 The Prison Policy Initiative 
project that 6% of Americans will be imprisoned at 
some point in their lifetimes, including one in 10 men 
and almost one in three African-American men.2  
The impact of high incarceration rates extends beyond 
the effects on inmates and their families. There are large 
societal costs, directly and indirectly, with each crime 
and corresponding imprisonment. Direct costs consist 
of the expenses to house prisoners and other forms of 
public expenditures within the criminal justice system. 
A 2017 estimate places the cost to house prisoners at 
$80.7 billion, while the costs of policing, courts, health 
care, and various other expenses brings the total price to 
$182 billion.3 The cost of crime on victims themselves is 
another significant, if difficult to quantify, cost of 
criminal activity. 
The indirect costs of imprisonment are also a concern 
and may be even more impactful to society. For 
example, incarceration decreases employment, social

Act of 1986 and the expansion of three-strikes laws in the 1990s. 
engagement, civic participation, and education rates 
for the incarcerated. Imprisoning parents increases the 
likelihood that their children also end up in prison.4  
With all the costs and negative impacts of 
incarceration, how could the situation be improved? 
Because a sizable portion of prisoners are repeat 
offenders, one strategy is to rehabilitate the 
incarcerated and provide them with education or 
training while in prison.5 This will set them up for 
productive and legal work when released.  
Unfortunately, this effort is not new, and the 
disappointing prospects of rehabilitation eventually 
gave way to the ‘70's mindset of "nothing works."6 This 
conclusion led to bipartisan support for increasingly 
punitive prison sentences and a reduction in 
rehabilitation programs. After all, if nothing worked in 
rehabilitating criminals, why waste money on education 
and training instead of just locking the cell and 
throwing away the key? Combined with a dramatic 
increase in crime and escalating punishments in the ‘80s 
and ‘90s, incarceration rates dramatically increased.* 
While incarceration rates have recently slowed (down 
from the peak in the 2000s), they remain high and are 
four times the rates in the 1970s.7 Education programs 
within prisons are gradually experiencing a resurgence 
as funding for programs is restored.8 Government

action — such as the First Step Act or the expansion of 
Second Chance Pell Grants — has devoted more 
resources and public money to prison education. 
But the question remains: Do these programs work? If 
so, what are the costs associated with the dollars spent 
and dollars saved (if any), and what is the impact on 
prisoners? These critical questions must be answered 
to ensure education programs are effective and dollars 
are invested wisely. 
Prison education programs 
Studies on education programs in prison settings 
have been conducted for years. However, they 
evaluate different programs (e.g., college courses vs. 
vocational training), measure different impacts (cost 
savings vs. recidivism), and occur across different 
states. This makes it challenging to know the overall, 
or typical, effect of these efforts. 
Recognizing this challenge, we methodically found and 
reviewed 750 research papers published between 1980 
and 2022 related to prison education programs. Of 
these, we identified 78 that examined the impact of 
these programs on one or more outcomes. These 
studies were the source of a meta-analysis that included 
148 unique estimates of the causal effects of prison 
education programs assessed in the identified studies.  
This meta-analysis is the largest on the topic to date 
and features a substantial portion of studies of the 
highest quality. Of the 148 estimates, 105 come from 
papers that use random assignment or quasi-random 
assignment to estimate the effect of prison programs. 
These types of studies are typically the best way to 
estimate the causal relationships between an 
intervention and an outcome. In other words, this 
study is the first to calculate the impact of different 
prison education programs using only high-quality 
studies. Three different outcomes are considered: 
recidivism, employment, and wages.  
Impact on recidivism 
Recidivism occurs when someone reoffends and 
returns to prison. Educational and training programs 
in prison appear to reduce recidivism rates. The 
results from this meta-analysis suggest that 
participation in any form of educational program 
leads to a 14.8% decrease in the likelihood of 
recidivism. This effect is slightly smaller at 11.3% 
when restricting the results to the highest quality 
papers. And when considering studies published 
since 2010, the estimates decrease to about 7%.  
A decline in effectiveness based on more recent 
research is not surprising. Expanding programs to less 
interested participants may impact the outcome. 
However, a decline in recidivism of between 7% to 15% 
is a significant success. That means, for instance, that 
for every 1,000 inmates served by prison education and 
later released, between 70 and 150 fewer will return to 
prison than otherwise would.  
Impact on employment 
after incarceration  
Reduced employment opportunities after 
incarceration are a vital factor to consider when 
weighing the impact of imprisonment. In this study, 
30 papers captured data on the effect of educational 
programs on employment. Estimates for the full 
sample suggest that participating in education 
programs while incarcerated increases the likelihood 
of being employed after release by 6.9% above what is 
typically expected. Moreover, recent studies (since 
2010) provide a similar estimate, with the probability 
of employment rising to 7.6%. This means that for 
every 1,000 students completing education while 
incarcerated, about 30 more will be employed after 
being released than otherwise would be.

Impact on wages after incarceration 
Employment effects and wage rates should be 
considered together. After all, the goal is for former 
inmates both to stay employed and to earn enough to 
be productive citizens and family members, thereby 
reducing their chance of reoffending. 
Prison education programs increase post-release 
wages by an average of $131 per quarter. While this 
may seem a modest increase, it is a positive signal. 
The workers most affected by schooling are often 
marginal workers whose wages were expected to be 
lower than average. Not only are released prisoners 
more likely to find work, but those who do find work 
earn more at those jobs than those who do not 
receive education while incarcerated.  
Impact by type of education program 
Based on the 105 highest quality estimates included in 
this meta-analysis, four types of educational offerings 
in prisons were considered individually: 
• 
Adult Basic Education, or ABE: 
Remedial reading, writing, mathematics, etc. 
• 
Secondary Education: 
GED or high school diploma 
• 
Vocational Education: 
Job skills training and job preparedness 
• 
College Education: 
Associate’s, Bachelor’s or Master’s degrees

College

All forms of education appear to provide some benefit, 
but there is variation in their relative effects. College 
education reduces recidivism the most, leading to a 
27.7% decrease in the probability of recidivism. This is 
followed by vocational education at 9.4%, secondary 
education at 7.2%, and ABE at 6.3%. The significant 
difference between college and other forms of 
education could be related to the different lengths of 
time students participate in the programs. College 
programs, for instance, often take multiple years for 
students to complete. 
The impact on employment across different 
educational types is more challenging to estimate. ABE 
and secondary education have negligible effects on 
employment, with increases of 1.5% and 1.2%, 
respectively. Vocational education increases 
employment by 5.5%, while college programs increase 
employment by 10.5%. However, this effect is 
estimated using only a single paper, so the results 
cannot be stated with as much confidence.

Returns on investment 
The study summarized here collected numerous 
calculations of the average cost, per participant, of 
each form of educational program. While there is 
considerable variation across programs, these averages 
provide helpful estimates of the average program's 
cost. Results indicate that ABE and secondary 
education are the least expensive, both averaging an 
annual cost of $1,987 per participant. Vocational 
education costs slightly more at $2,126, and college 
education programs are the costliest, with an average 
of $10,467 annually per participant. 
These costs were compared to the estimated benefits 
of recidivism reduction, increased employment and 
higher wages. The Bureau of Justice Statistics 
estimates that the average prison stay is 2.7 years.9 The 
Vera Institute of Justice calculates the average cost of 
imprisonment to be $40,028 per prisoner per year (in 
2022 dollars).10 Combined, this means that each return 
to prison costs approximately $107,000. The 
Department of Justice estimates that the average 
quarterly wage for released prisoners in the third year 
following release is $5,600 per quarter.11  
Using these numbers, the estimated cost savings (i.e., 
via the reduction in recidivism) and economic 
benefits (i.e., higher wages and employment) that 
come from participation in prison schooling reveal 
that each dollar spent on ABE education yields $2.04. 
For secondary education, each dollar spent yields 
$2.25, $3.10 for vocational education, and $1.61 for 
college education. 
These estimates do not include the social costs of 
crime, such as the costs of victimization, nor the costs 
to police departments, courts and other various, less 
tangible costs. Since all these costs should increase as 
crime increases, the calculations on the returns to 
investment, which capture only fiscal benefits 
experienced by prisons or prisoners, are likely low.  
A college education (due to its high cost) yields the 
lowest return for each dollar spent despite having the 
most significant impact. However, considering the 
greatest economic benefit per participant, college 
education has the highest effect, yielding $16,863 in 
benefit per college participant. 
For each form of education, the wage and employment 
benefits experienced by the students themselves are 
lower than the program's cost. In other words, while 
education provides a positive return on investment, 
most of those benefits will not benefit the students 
directly (e.g., from wage increases and employment 
opportunities). Instead, the larger benefit is to the 
community, through reduced costs for not having to 
incarcerate as many people.  
ABE, secondary, and vocational education each cost 
about $2,000 per participant. As a result, the 
breakeven point for recidivism reduction is about two 
percentage points, well below the decreases in 
recidivism of ABE (2.9 percentage points), secondary 
(3.3 percentage points), and vocational (4.31 
percentage points). With the high cost of housing 
prisoners, even a tiny decrease in recidivism is

enough to justify the cost of prison education. The 
breakeven point for college is about 9-10 percentage 
points, again below the effect of college education in 
reducing recidivism (12.7 percentage points). 
Summary 
The findings summarized here result from the largest 
meta-analysis on the impact of prisoner education 
programs in the United States, compiling 148 
estimates from 78 research papers. The effect of 
college, vocational, secondary, and adult basic 
education on prisoner recidivism, employment, and 
wages are evaluated. Findings indicate that 
participating in a prison education program: 
• 
Decreases the likelihood of recidivism by 14.8%. 
• 
Increases likelihood of employment by 6.9%. 
• 
Increases quarterly wages for employed ex-
offenders by $131. 
Some of these impacts shown in the research have 
declined slightly in recent years and are not even 
across all types of education. For example, secondary 
education and ABE have the smallest effect, while 
vocational training programs are highly effective given 
their low cost. Despite significantly higher costs, 
college education has the largest impact.  
All forms of education provide cost-saving 
opportunities for states by reducing recidivism. Given 
the high incarceration costs, most of this benefit 
comes through prison-related costs, but participants 
benefit, too, from increased wages. Considering both 
of these benefits, the return on investment is robust 
for ABE at 104%, vocational education at 122%, and 
secondary education with a 210% ROI. The return for 
more expensive college programs is still positive at 
61%. Vocational education programs provide the 
highest return for each dollar spent ($3.10), and 
college education providers the highest benefit per 
student ($16,861). 
Policy recommendations 
1. Create educational and training programs and 
expand existing programs in prisons. These will 
pay for themselves by reducing prison housing 
costs and likely reducing victimization and other 
indirect costs.  
2. Keep educational programs free to prisoners. 
From a cost-benefit perspective, the biggest gains 
from these programs are experienced collectively 
by taxpayers. If prisoners are required to pay for 
these programs, the costs may discourage them 
from participating.  
3. Given that all four forms of education are beneficial, 
prisons should offer all forms. Students could 
progress through multiple programs, increasing the 
total benefits of prison education. This could 
amplify the positive effects of these education 
programs. The effect of ABE programs, for instance, 
will be greater if it enables prisoners to go on to 
participate in secondary or vocational programs.
