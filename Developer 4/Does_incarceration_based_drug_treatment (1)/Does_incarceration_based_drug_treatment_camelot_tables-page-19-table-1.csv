"istics of the offenders that maintain or foster their criminality, and,
to a lesser degree,"
"their drug use. Additional
research is needed that examines the role of
reducing an"
"offender’s drug use in reducing future non-drug-use criminal behavior."
"We believe
that
the
implications of
this
research for policy makers
are
clear."
"Policy makers seeking effective interventions for incarcerated substance abusers are"
"most
likely to find success with programs
that
focus on the multiple problems of"
"substance
abusers
in an intensive manner,
such as TC programs. Policy makers"
"should expect
smaller
treatment benefits
from less
intensive
treatment programs."
"Further,
there
is no evidence
that
correctional boot
camps
targeted at
substance"
"abusers
reduce either post-release offending or drug use, and,
thus, policy makers"
"should not expect
these programs to produce reductions in recidivism."
"We believe that
this research also has implications for
researchers. Specifically,"
"we believe that while the extant research clearly supports the effectiveness of certain"
"programs,
there is a lack of understanding concerning which particular components"
"of treatment programs are most important and which combination of components are"
"most effective. Further,
the general methodological weakness of this area of research"
"makes
their
findings
vulnerable
to
alternative
explanations
(i.e.,
reductions
in"
"recidivism could be due
to factors other
than the
intervention). Beneficial
future"
"research will address these issues."
