"offending, but the limited available evidence was decidedly mixed in regards to drug"
"use outcomes."
"Likewise, evaluations of counseling programs indicated that
these programs were"
"associated with
statistically
significant
reductions
in
re-offending
but
that
these"
"programs’ effects on drug use were ambiguous.
In particular,
the 25 evaluations of"
"counseling programs exhibited the largest mean odds ratio on re-offending outcomes"
"(1.50, 95% CI 1.25–1.79). Once again,
the available evidence is scant
in regards to"
"drug use, with only three evaluations reporting drug use outcomes. Two of the three"
"effect sizes were greater
than, 1 indicating that program participants had less post-"
"release drug use; however, one effect size was substantially less than 1. Combined,"
"these three odds ratios yielded a mean odds ratio of 0.77 (95% CI 0.35–1.67)."
"A particularly
small
number
of
evaluations
assessed
the
effectiveness
of"
"incarceration-based narcotic maintenance or boot camp programs for drug offenders."
"The handful of extant evaluations of narcotic maintenance programs indicated that"
"participation in maintenance programs was associated with substantially significant"
"reductions in drug use but not
re-offending. All four of the odds ratios for drug use"
"outcomes
indicated that participation in narcotic maintenance programs produced"
"lower
post-release
drug
use
than
not-participating;
this
random-effect mean
is"
"substantively
large,
1.94,
but
it was
not
statistically
significant
(p=0.11). By"
"contrast,
three of
the four odds ratios for offending indicated that participants were"
"more likely to re-offend than were non-participants. The two available evaluations of"
"boot
camps
indicated
that
these
programs were
not
associated with
statistically"
"significant
reductions
in either
re-offending or drug use. Both of
the
evaluations"
"measuring re-offending outcomes
found that boot
camp participants had slightly"
"lower
rates
of
re-offending
than
non-participants
did
(i.e.,
both
evaluations
had"
"logged odds ratios less than 0.14)."
"As further evidence of the importance of primary type of treatment, we found that"
"the
association between odds
ratio and several moderator variables depended on"
"whether the odds ratio came from the evaluation of a TC or of a counseling program."
"Therefore, we
conducted
separate moderator
analyses
for
TC and
counseling"
"programs
in a series of parallel analyses. The odds
ratios concerning boot camp,"
"narcotic maintenance, and ambiguous programs were set aside for
these analyses."
"Table
2
examines
variation
in
the
odds
ratios
for
offending
by
coded"
"that
methodological
features. One of
the most
important
findings
from Table 2 is"
"the
vast majority
of
the mean
odds
ratios were
statistically
significant, which"
"suggests that the finding that TC participants had lower rates of re-offending than did"
"non-participants was largely robust to methodological variations. The first moderator"
"variable, “overall method quality,” was a four-point ordinal measure of
the internal"
"validity
of
each
evaluation.
This
four-point
categorization was
similar
to
the"
"University of Maryland’s Scientific Methods Scale (see Farrington et al. 2006). The"
"lowest
level
of method
quality was
“weak
quasi-experimental
designs.” These"
"studies utilized a comparison that
lacked comparability to the treatment group before"
"the intervention. The next
level of method quality, “standard quasi-experiment,” was"
"assigned to evaluations characterized by research designs
that used a comparison"
"group that was
slightly different
from the treatment group on important observed"
"variables before the intervention. “Rigorous quasi-experiments” were characterized"
"as
evaluations
involving
treatment
and
comparison
groups
that were
