"that were:
(1) general
(i.e., covered all offense types as opposed to being offense"
"specific), (2) based on re-arrests, (3) dichotomous, and (4) followed sample members"
"for 12 months. We decided to select such effect sizes because this type of outcome"
"measure was the most commonly reported outcome measure. For evaluations that did"
"not
report
such
an
outcome, we
coded
the
available
outcome
that most
closely"
"resembled this preferred outcome measure. Thus,
the re-offending data set primarily"
"contained outcome measures concerning re-arrest
rates
in the first 12-months after"
"release. Similarly,
for
the
drug
use
data
set, we
selected
effect
sizes
that were:"
"(1) general (i.e., concerning any illicit drug use), (2) dichotomous, and, (3) followed"
"sample members
for 12 months. Consequently,
the drug relapse data set primarily"
"contained outcomes concerning drug relapse in the first 12 months after release."
"Results"
"Description of eligible studies and evaluations"
"Our search strategy uncovered 233 potentially eligible studies. We were able to obtain"
"copies of 229 of
these studies. Of
the retrieved studies, 53 unique studies met our"
"eligibility criteria. These 53 unique studies
reported the results of 66 independent"
"evaluations, as several studies contained multiple evaluations. Of these evaluations, 58"
"had been conducted in the United States of America,
three had been conducted in"
"Australia, three had been conducted in Canada, one had been conducted in the UK, and"
"one evaluation had been conducted in Taiwan. Approximately half of the evaluations"
"(32) were coded from studies published as journal articles or book chapters, and the"
"other 34 evaluations were coded from unpublished technical reports and government"
"documents. In regards to date of publication, two-thirds of the evaluations were coded"
"from studies made available after 1996—the latest date eligible for inclusion in Pearson"
"and Lipton’s (1999) review;
thus,
the vast majority of the evaluations included in the"
"current research were not
included in the earlier
review."
"The bulk of the evaluations assessed either TC or counseling programs. of the 66"
"evaluations,
30
examined
the
effectiveness
of
TC programs,
and
another
25"
"evaluations were of counseling programs. Relatively few of
the evaluations were"
"of
narcotic maintenance
programs
or
boot
camp
programs
designed
for
drug"
"offenders:
five
and two evaluations,
respectively. And primary type of
treatment"
"modality could not be reliably coded for
four evaluations."
"Mean odds ratio for re-offending and drug use outcomes"
"Of
the 66 evaluations, 65 reported at
least one re-offending outcome measure. One"
"odds ratio was an outlier in the negative direction;
this odds ratio was “Winsorized”"
"to
the
5th
percentile.1 Approximately
83% of
the
65
odds
ratios
for
offending"
"1 The outlier came from an evaluation of a narcotics maintenance program (Magura et al. 1993,
female"
"sample). The logged odds ratio for
this contrast was -4.61,
indicating that
the comparison group had a"
"lower
rate of post-release offending than the treatment group did. No other
logged odds
ratio had an"
"absolute value of 2 or more. Alternative analyses that excluded this outlier yielded substantively similar"
"results."
