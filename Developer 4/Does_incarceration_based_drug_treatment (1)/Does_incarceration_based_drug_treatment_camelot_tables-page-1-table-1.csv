"Abstract This
research
synthesized
results
from 66
published
and
unpublished"
"evaluations
of
incarceration-based
drug
treatment
programs
using meta-analysis."
"Incarceration-based
drug
treatment
programs
fell
into
five
types:
therapeutic"
"communities
(TCs),
residential
substance abuse treatment
(RSAT), group counsel-"
"ing, boot camps specifically for drug offenders, and narcotic maintenance programs."
"We examined the effectiveness of each of
these types of
interventions in reducing"
"post-release offending and drug use, and we also examined whether differences in"
"research findings can be explained by variations in methodology, sample, or program"
"features. Our results consistently found support for the effectiveness of TC programs"
"on both outcome measures,
and this
finding was
robust
to variations
in method,"
"sample, and program features. We also found support for the effectiveness of RSAT"
"and group counseling programs in reducing re-offending, but these programsâ€™ effects"
"on drug use were ambiguous. A limited number of evaluations assessed narcotic"
"maintenance or boot camp programs; however,
the existing evaluations found mixed"
"support
for maintenance programs and no support
for boot camps."
