O. Mitchell, et al."
"Search strategy"
"The goal of the search strategy was to identify all studies, published or unpublished,"
"that met
the
above
eligibility
criteria. The
search
began
by
our
conducting
a"
"computerized
keyword
search
of
bibliographic
databases.
In
particular, we"
"conducted
a
search
of
the
following
databases:
PsychLit, MedLine, NCJRS,"
"Criminal
Justice Abstracts, Dissertation Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, Social"
"Science Citation Index, SocioFile, Conference Papers Index, UnCover, C2 SPECTR,"
"and CINAHL, as well as Google internet searches. The keywords used were: drug"
"treatment, substance abuse treatment, drug counseling,
therapeutic community(ies),"
"methadone maintenance,
boot
camp(s),
offenders,
residential
substance
abuse"
"treatment, RSAT,
inmates,
incarceration,
incarcerated, prison, evaluation, outcome"
"evaluation, and recidivism. These keywords were used in various combinations."
"We also searched for eligible evaluations by carefully reading existing reviews of"
"unfamiliar
research.
In
particular, we
reviewed
the
reference
lists
of
existing"
"syntheses to identify potentially eligible evaluations. Likewise, many of the eligible"
"studies
reviewed the work of
similar
studies;
these studies were also assessed for"
"eligibility. Additionally, we reviewed the Digest of Research on Drug Use and HIV/"
"2004), which
abstracts much
of
the
“grey”
AIDS
in Prisons
(Flanagan
et
al."
"literature, particularly European grey research."
"Further, we
searched websites
of
several
prominent
research
organizations."
"Specifically, we searched for
relevant
research reports on the following websites:"
"Correctional Service Canada’s research publications page;
the Home Office; RAND"
"Drug Policy Research Center; The Urban Institute’s crime/justice research page; and,"
"Vera Institute of Justice’s publications page."
"Finally, we hand-searched the titles/abstracts of articles published between 1999"
"and
2004
in
the
following
journals:
Journal
of
Substance
Abuse
Treatment,"
"International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology, Journal"
"of Drug Issues, The Prison Journal, Crime & Delinquency, and Journal of Offender"
"Rehabilitation. We chose to hand-search these journals because they have a strong"
"track record of publishing relevant
studies,
and many of
these
journals were not"
"indexed well by the computerized databases we utilized."
"All studies that could not be ruled ineligible, based on a preliminary review of the"
"title and abstract, were retrieved. That
is, we reviewed each title/abstract
looking for"
"clear
evidence
that
the
study violated one or more of
the
eligibility criteria. For"
"example,
the first eligibility criterion was that all studies evaluated an intervention"
"administered in a correctional
facility;
thus,
if a title/abstract clearly indicated that"
"the study assessed a program that was not administered in a correctional facility, then"
"the study was not retrieved for further scrutiny. We read closely the retrieved studies"
"to determine final eligibility status."
"It
is
important
to
note
that
the
unit
of
analysis
in
this meta-analysis
is
the"
"evaluation—a contrast between one treatment group and one comparison group. We"
"distinguish studies, documents reporting the results of an evaluation or evaluations,"
"from evaluations, specific contrasts between a treatment and comparison group. This"
"distinction is necessary,
as
several
studies
reported the
results of more
than one"
"evaluation;
that
is, evaluations were nested within studies."
