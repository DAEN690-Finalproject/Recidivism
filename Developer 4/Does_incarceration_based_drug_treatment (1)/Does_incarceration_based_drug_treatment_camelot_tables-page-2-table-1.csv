"programs
in reducing recidivism is
ambiguous.
In the United States of America,"
"research suggests
that between 40% and 45% of
inmates are drug dependent. For"
"example,
a
2002
study
of US jail
inmates
found
that
nearly
half
(45%) were"
"substance dependent and another 23% reported substance abuse symptoms (Karberg"
"findings
from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring
and James 2005). Similarly,"
"(ADAM)
program revealed
that
the median
rate
of
drug
dependence
among"
"incarcerated arrestees in 39 US cities was 39% (Zhang 2003). High levels of drug"
"dependence
also
have
been
found
in
samples
from England
and Canada.
For"
"example, a study of
incarcerated arrestees in five English cities found that 45% of"
"inmates were
drug
dependent
at
one
point
in
their
lives
and
33% were
drug"
"dependent at
the time of interview (Bennett 1998). Likewise, a sample of Canadian"
"federal prisoners found that
the rate of drug dependence was between 31% and 43%"
"(Pernaen et al. 2002)."
"In the absence of effective abuse treatment,
it
is likely that a high proportion of"
"these drug-dependent offenders will
re-offend. Research consistently indicates
that"
"drug-using probationers/parolees
recidivate at higher
rates
than do non-drug users"
"(see e.g., Bureau of Justice Statistics 1995; Gendreau et al. 1996; Horney et al. 1995;"
"the period of
incarceration is a potentially critical
MacKenzie et al. 1999). Thus,"
"opportunity to intervene in this cycle of drug use and crime. However,
the two most"
"common types of drug abuse interventions in US prisons and jails, self-help 12-step"
"and drug education programs, have not been demonstrated to reduce recidivism,
in"
"existing reviews of
the literature (Pearson and Lipton 1999; Lipton et al. 1992)."
"In
recognition
of
the
potential
of
incarceration-based
drug
treatment,
the"
"limitations of existing programs, and the rising need for effective substance abuse"
"interventions, US Congress
created
the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment"
"(RSAT) Program under
the Violent Crime Control
and Law Enforcement Act of"
"financial
1994 [Bureau of
Justice Assistance (BJA) 2005]. This program provides"
"assistance
to
local
and
state
correctional
facilities
to
develop
and
implement"
"incarceration-based drug treatment programs. Between fiscal years 1996 and 2003,"
"more than $400 million have been provided to the states under this program; and as"
"of July 2004, 300 RSAT programs were in operation (BJA 2005)."
"This tremendous investment
in incarceration-based drug treatment programs and"
"their proliferation present a host of
important questions that need to be addressed,"
"such
as: Are
incarceration-based
drug
treatment
programs
effective
in
reducing"
"recidivism? Does the existing body of
research indicate that participation in RSAT-"
"funded programs
reduces
recidivism? Are there particular
types of drug treatment"
"that are especially effective or
ineffective? Approximately how effective are these"
"programs? What
characteristics
differentiate
effective
programs
from ineffective"
"programs? This research attempts to answer these questions by synthesizing existing"
"evaluations
of
incarceration-based
drug
treatment
programs
using
systematic,"
"quantitative review techniques."
"Common incarceration-based drug treatment programs and their effectiveness"
"Many correctional
interventions could be interpreted as “incarceration-based drug"
"treatment.” We defined incarceration-based drug treatment programs as interventions"
