emphasis);
the
remaining
eight
evaluations
did
not
supply
enough"
"information to be reliably classified and are listed as “Unknown emphasis” in Table 5."
"The evaluations classified into the unknown emphasis category exhibited the largest"
"mean
odds
ratio
(2.14, with
95% CI
of
1.54–2.97), whereas,
evaluations
of"
"multifaceted programs yielded the smallest mean odds ratio (1.21, with 95% CI of"
"0.85–1.72).
Post-hoc
contrasts
indicated
that
the
evaluations
in
the
unknown"
"emphasis category had statistically larger mean odds ratio than did either evaluations"
"of
cognitive
behavioral
therapy
or multifaceted
counseling;
none
of
the
other"
"categories differed statistically from one another. Thus,
the strongest evidence of the"
"effectiveness
of
counseling
programs
comes
from evaluations without
a
clear"
"depiction
of
the
treatment
provided
to
program participants.
Interestingly,
the"
"evidence suggests that the most popular incarceration-based drug treatment modality,"
"12-step/drug education, exhibited a substantively and statistically significant mean"
"odds ratio of 1.54 (95% CI 1.00–2.36)."
"One
other
treatment
characteristic was
related
to
odds
ratio. Evaluations
of"
"programs that were strictly voluntary had a statistically larger mean odds ratio than"
"did other evaluations of counseling programs.
In fact, evaluations in which at
least"
"some program participants did not volunteer
for
treatment produced a mean odds"
"ratio (1.07) that did not differ statistically or substantively from 1.00, which suggests"
"that
in such evaluations program participants and non-participants had similar
rates"
"of
re-offending."
"Discussion"
"In
concordance with
the
authors
of
existing
reviews
(e.g., Wilson
et
al.
2005;"
"Pearson and Lipton 1999), we found no evidence that participation in boot camp"
"programs reduced post-release offending or drug use. While the number of existing"
"evaluations of boot camp programs
for drug offenders was very small, given the"
"consistency of our findings to other research on boot camps,
it appears unlikely that"
"boot camp programs generally reduce recidivism."
"The evidence concerning the effectiveness of narcotic maintenance programs was"
"mixed. We found no evidence of the effectiveness of such programs in reducing re-"
"offending;
in fact, program participants had somewhat higher re-offending rates than"
"non-participants
in
four
out
of
the
five
evaluations. By
contrast,
all
existing"
"evaluations found somewhat
lower rates of post-release drug use among participants"
"than
non-participants,
and
the
random-effects mean
odds
ratio
for
these
four"
"evaluations was
substantively
large
(1.95).
Thus,
incarceration-based
narcotic"
"maintenance programs may reduce drug use, but
the scant existing evidence does"
"not
indicate
that
such
program reduce
re-offending. Our
ability
to
draw firm"
"conclusions in this area of research, however, is undermined by the limited statistical"
"power of our analyses. Continued research investigating the effectiveness of
these"
"programs would be a significant contribution to the knowledge base."
"The most consistent evidence of treatment effectiveness came from evaluations of"
"TC programs. These programs
consistently showed post-release
reductions
in re-"
"offending and drug relapse. This finding was robust
to methodological variation. In"
"fact, even among the most
rigorous evaluations, participation in TC programs was"
