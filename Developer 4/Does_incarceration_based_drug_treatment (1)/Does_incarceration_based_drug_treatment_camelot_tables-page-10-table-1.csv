"magnitude of
the difference between categories
in terms of
the logged odds
ratio."
"Specifically,
if a moderator variable’s categories differed by a logged odds ratio of"
"0.20 or more, and each category had a least
five evaluations,
then we considered"
"such
differences
as
substantively
significant.
Similarly,
if
one
category
of
a"
"moderator had fewer
than five evaluations, and the difference between categories"
"was 0.40 or more,
then we considered such differences as substantively significant."
"Third, all of
the moderator analyses were essentially bivariate. Unfortunately,
the"
"limited number of available effect sizes, and the sparseness of the data sets utilized,"
"made multivariate data analysis highly problematic, and the results of such analyses"
"were very sensitive
to small
alternations
(e.g.,
excluding one observation). As
a"
"result,
these
bivariate
findings were
vulnerable
to
spuriousness. Given
these"
"challenges,
the following moderator analyses are offered as suggestive."
"The first moderator variable examined was primary type of
intervention. Table 1"
"displays
the random-effects mean odds
ratio effect size for each type of
treatment"
"program for re-offending and drug use outcomes. Analysis of these means indicated"
"that
treatment effectiveness on both types of outcome measures varied considerably"
"by primary type of
intervention (re-offending: Q=6.36 with df=3, p=0.09. This"
"analysis excludes the “ambiguous” category, drug use: Q=4.29 with df=2, p=0.12)."
"The mean odds ratio for TC programs on re-offending outcomes was 1.38, with a"
"95% CI of 1.17 to 1.62. As
this CI did not
include 1.00,
this mean odds
ratio is"
"statistically significant at
the 0.05 level. Similarly,
the mean odds
ratio for
the 12"
"evaluations of TC programs on drug use outcomes was 1.41 (95% CI 0.95-2.05, p<"
"0.10). These findings indicated that TC participants generally had statistically lower"
"rates of
re-offending and drug use after
release
from incarceration than did non-"
"participants."
"Ten of
the TC evaluations were RSAT-funded programs (not shown in Table 1)."
"These ten evaluations yielded a mean odds ratio of 1.39 (95% CI 1.10–1.76) for the"
"re-offending outcomes. Only four of
the ten RSAT evaluations assessed a drug use"
"outcome;
two
of
these
evaluations
indicated
that
participants
in RSAT-funded"
"programs
had
lower
drug
use
rates
than
non-participants,
and
the
other
two"
"evaluations found just
the opposite. Not surprisingly, given these conflicting results,"
"the overall mean odds
ratio from these four evaluations was 1.02 (95% CI 0.48–"
"2.15), which
indicates
no
difference. Thus,
the

evidence
