"Narcotic maintenance programs [i.e., methadone and levo-alpha-acetyl-methadol"
"(LAAM) maintenance] are pharmacological approaches. These programs attempt
to"
"reduce
the harms
associated with
opiate dependency (e.g., disease
transmission,"
"criminal
activity) by prescribing synthetic opioid medication. Unlike heroin and"
"other
strong opiates,
these medications do not produce
a
euphoric high;
instead,"
"methadone and LAAM block the euphoric high produced by opiate use and suppress"
"opiate withdrawal
symptoms.
Incarceration-based narcotic maintenance programs"
"link released inmates to community-based programs for continued care. The success"
"of
incarceration-based maintenance programs appears
to be heavily dependent on"
"their ability to place released offenders into community-based programs."
"Each of the above types of drug interventions has the potential
to reduce drug use"
"and other criminal behaviors. However, existing systematic reviews of
this body of"
"research
have
found
that
only
participation
in
TC programs was
consistently"
"associated with reductions
in recidivism.
In particular, Pearson and Lipton (1999)"
"systematically reviewed experimental and quasi-experimental
research assessing the"
"effectiveness
of
corrections-based
drug
abuse
programs
in
reducing
recidivism"
"conducted in any country and completed between 1968 and 1996,
inclusive. Their"
"search revealed 30 studies meeting their eligibility criteria. These authors found that"
"six of the seven TC evaluations indicated that participants exhibited lower recidivism"
"than non-participants;
the overall mean weighted r effect size was 0.133 (p=0.025)."
"By contrast,
the mean effect size was not statistically significant and near zero for"
"both boot
camp and group counseling programs. Although Pearson and Lipton’s"
"review found too few studies of methadone maintenance, drug education, cognitive-"
"behavioral, and 12-step programs
to draw strong conclusions,
it characterized the"
"existing evidence of
these programs’ effectiveness as being promising."
"In many regards,
this systematic review is an extension of
the work by Pearson"
"and Lipton. Like
that
earlier work,
this
synthesis
systematically and comprehen-"
"sively reviews the effects of incarceration-based drug interventions on post-treatment"
"drug use and other types of criminal behaviors, using meta-analytic procedures. The"
"primary difference between their work and the current systematic review is that
this"
"research project uses a more current
time frame (1980 through 2004). We believe"
"that
this difference is
salient
for
two reasons:
(1) more recent evaluations of drug"
"treatment
interventions may be more generalizable to current correctional practices;"
"and, (2) numerous evaluations of incarceration-based drug treatment programs have"
"been conducted since 1996, particularly evaluations of RSAT programs."
