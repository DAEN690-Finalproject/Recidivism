"Incarceration-based drug treatment

"facility;
(2)
the intervention specifically targeted substance users;
(3)
the evaluation"
"used an experimental or two-group quasi-experimental research design that included a"
"no-treatment or minimal
treatment comparison group;
(4)
the evaluation reported a"
"post-release outcome measuring offending or drug use;
(5)
the
intervention was"
"conducted between 1980 and 2004,
inclusive; and,
(6)
the evaluation had to report"
"enough information for us to calculate an effect size."
"Regarding the first eligibility criterion, our operational definition of “correctional"
"facilities”
included only jails
and prisons,
and analogous
facilities
for
juveniles."
"Interventions conducted at half-way houses or community-based residential facilities"
"were not
included.
It
is worth noting that
this criterion excluded a small number of"
"notable evaluations. Specifically, programs designed to be alternatives
to incarcer-"
"ation,
such as
those
reported in Dynia
and Sung (2000)
and Knight
and Hiller"
"(1997), were excluded by this criterion."
"The
second
criterion
restricted
the
focus
of
this
review to
evaluations
that"
"specifically targeted drug users. Therapeutic interventions conducted in correctional"
"facilities that were generally available to offenders regardless of an offender’s drug"
"history were not
included. For instance, Shaw and MacKenzie (1992) evaluated the"
"effects of a boot camp program on a sub-sample of drug-using offenders; however,"
"this evaluation was excluded because the boot camp program was not specifically"
"targeted at drug users. By contrast, Zhang (2000) evaluated a boot camp program"
"specifically geared towards drug users—this evaluation was included in this review."
"This criterion was necessary, because this
review is concerned with incarceration-"
"based drug treatment; without
this
criterion,
the present
review would become
a"
"review of
incarcerated-based treatment comprised of drug users."
"The third criterion specified that all included evaluations must have a comparison/"
"control group that
received no treatment or minimal
treatment. Thus, we excluded"
"quasi-experiments that
involved comparisons of two or more interventions that were"
"roughly comparable or whose comparability in terms of effectiveness
in reducing"
"recidivism was
in dispute (i.e.,
treatment–treatment comparisons or dose–response"
"evaluations). For example, the comparison group in the study by Swartz et al. (1996)"
"was constructed by dividing program participants into four groups based upon length"
"of program participation. Evaluations utilizing such comparison groups were not"
"included in this systematic review. Furthermore, we did not
include evaluations in"
"which the comparison group was comprised predominantly or
solely of dropouts"
"from the intervention of
interest. For
instance, evaluations
such as
those by Field"
"(1985, 1989) and Berggren and Svard (1990)
that used program drop-outs as
the"
"comparison group were excluded from this systematic review."
"The
fourth and fifth criteria
are
largely self-explanatory. We
chose
to exclude"
"studies
conducted
before
1980,
because we
questioned
the
generalizability
of"
"findings
from such
studies
to
current
correctional
contexts.
It
is
important
to"
"emphasize, however,
that all evaluations needed to report a post-release measure of"
"recidivism. This
criterion excluded a
few notable
evaluations,
such as
those by"
"Shewan et al.
(1996) and Dolan et al.
(2003), which reported in-prison outcomes."
"The last criterion excluded evaluations that did not report enough information for"
"us
to calculate an effect
size. This criterion was necessary for practical purposes."
"Unfortunately, a handful of otherwise eligible evaluations (e.g.,
those by Schippers"
"et al. 1998; Guerin 2002) were ruled ineligible on the basis of
this last criterion."
