"Coding of effect sizes and moderator variables"
"The coding forms employed in this review were structured hierarchically, so that we"
"could
recognize
explicitly
the
nested
nature
of
evaluations within
studies. Any"
"number of
effect
sizes
could be
coded from each evaluation using these
forms."
"Further,
the
coding
forms
captured
key
features
of
the
nature
of
the
treatment,"
"research
sample,
research methodology,
outcome measures,
and
direction
and"
"magnitude of observed effects."
"We coded at
least one effect size from each evaluation. We utilized the odds ratio"
"effect size for dichotomous outcomes, as this type of effect size is the most appropriate"
"for such outcomes (Lipsey and Wilson 2001). Indicators of criminal behavior based on"
"non-dichotomous
scales were coded using the standardized mean difference effect"
"size. Effect sizes were coded in a manner such that positive effect sizes indicated that"
"the treatment group had a more favorable outcome than the comparison group did"
"(i.e.,
less
re-offending or drug use). Odds
ratio and standardized mean difference"
"effect sizes were combined using the method developed by Hasselblad and Hedges"
"(1995). Specifically, mean difference effect sizes were transformed onto the odds ratio"
"effect size scale (see also Sánchez-Meca et al. 2003)."
"It
is
important
to note that many authors
in this body of
research report
their"
"findings
by
contrasting
participants who
completed
the
treatment
(“graduates”),"
"participants who failed to complete the treatment
(“failures”), and the comparison"
"group. Findings reported in this manner clearly open the door for selection bias, and,"
"thus,
such findings
are difficult
to interpret
(i.e., was
the observed reduction in"
"recidivism due to the treatment or selection bias). Whenever we encountered results"
"reported in this fashion, we re-calculated recidivism rates for the treatment group by"
"combining graduates with failures. We then compared this overall treatment group to"
"the comparison group. We believed that
this practice would reduce the likelihood"
"that selection bias would influence the results of
this meta-analysis."
"Our
analyses of
these
effect
sizes utilized the
statistical
approach outlined by"
"Lipsey and Wilson (2001) and Cooper and Hedges (1994). In particular, we used the"
"inverse variance method and assumed that
the
true
treatment
effects varied as
a"
"function of both measured (i.e., coded features of each evaluation) and unmeasured"
"differences between evaluations. This
analytic
approach required statistical
inde-"
"pendence of effect sizes. Several types of statistical dependencies were evident in the"
"coded evaluations. First,
it was common for evaluators to measure and analyze more"
"than one indicator of criminal behavior
(e.g.,
re-arrest,
re-conviction, drug use) or"
"analyze the same indicator of criminal behavior at multiple post-program follow-ups"
"(e.g., 6 months, 12 months). Second,
it was
also common for
authors
to report"
"findings from the same sample of
research participants in multiple studies."
"We employed several procedures to attain statistical
independence. As a first-step,"
"all evaluations were cross-checked against one another to ensure that each evaluation"
"was included no more than once in each data set. Next, we created two data sets, one for"
"drug use outcomes and another for re-offending outcomes. Some evaluations reported"
"more than one measure of drug use or re-offending:, instead of simply averaging these"
"multiple measures, we
selected particular outcomes of
interest
to maximize
com-"
"parability of outcomes. In particular, for re-offending measures, we selected effect sizes"
