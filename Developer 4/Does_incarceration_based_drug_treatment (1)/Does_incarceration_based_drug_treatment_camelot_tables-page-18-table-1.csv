"370
O. Mitchell, et al."
"consistently related to reductions
in re-offending. We
also found that TCs were"
"effective
in several different
types of
samples, which suggests
that TCs
can be"
"applied to a wide-range of offenders. However,
there was evidence of publication"
"bias in this area of research, and this bias appeared to cause the effectiveness of TC"
"programs to be over-estimated. This possibility tempers our
findings."
"Ten of
the 30 evaluations of TC programs were
evaluations of RSAT-funded"
"programs. These ten evaluations found evidence of effectiveness of RSAT programs"
"in reducing re-offending. Four of these evaluations assessed the impact of the RSAT"
"programs’ effectiveness on drug use. This limited evidence produced mixed results:"
"two evaluations found that participants had lower post-release rates of drug use, and"
"two evaluations
found that participants had higher post-release rates of drug use,"
"than did non-participants. Thus, such evaluations are as likely to find reductions in"
"drug use as they are to find increases."
"Similarly,
the
evidence
regarding
counseling
programs
indicated
that
these"
"programs were
effective
in
reducing
re-offending,
but,
once
again,
the
limited"
"evidence available on these programs’ effects on drug use was unclear. The analyses"
"of
odds
ratios
from evaluations
of
counseling
programs
revealed
that, while"
"counseling programs had a larger mean odds ratio than evaluations of TC programs"
"on
offending
outcomes,
the
positive
effects
of
counseling
programs were more"
"contingent. Evidence of
the effectiveness of counseling programs was strongest
in"
"evaluations that were rated as methodologically weak, composed of adult offenders,"
"and strictly voluntary. Regrettably, counseling interventions generally were poorly"
"described by the primary authors, and, as a result, we were unable to code precise"
"program features that may have distinguished the most effective programs."
"Interestingly,
evaluations
of
both
TC and
counseling
programs
found
that"
"treatment was
somewhat more effective in samples of women than in samples of"
"either men or mixed genders. This finding is particularly interesting, as incarcerated"
"female
offenders
are
disproportionately
drug
involved,
and
female
offenders"
"traditionally have had limited access
to high-quality treatment programs
(see e.g.,"
"Pollock 2004)."
"A surprising finding was the smaller effects of both TC and counseling programs"
"on drug-relapse measures than on measures of re-offending. A presumption of these"
"programs
is
that
their
effectiveness
in
reducing
re-offending
is mediating
by"
"reductions in drug use. As such, we would expect drug-relapse effects to be as large"
"as, or larger than, re-offending effects. An analysis of the relationship between drug"
"relapse
odds
ratios
and
re-offending
odds
ratios
showed
a
strong
relationship"
"between these two (unweighted correlation of 0.56 and a weighted correlation of"
"0.64),
indicating that
the
larger a program’s
effect on drug-relapse
the
larger
the"
"effect
on
recidivism (and
vice
versa),
consistent with
the
notion
that
drug
use"
"mediates criminality. This does not resolve, however,
the counterintuitive finding of"
"lower drug-relapse effects. Two possibilities come to mind. First, although official"
"measures of recidivism are known to be only modestly reliable indicators of criminal"
"behavior,
they may be more reliable than measures of drug-relapse.
If
this is true,"
"then the latter are attenuated to a greater degree than the former. Second, drug use"
"may not mediate
the
relationship between these programs
and criminal behavior."
"These
programs may
successfully
change
criminogenic
attitudes,
attachment
of"
"antisocial peers, maladaptive cognitive processes, or other psychosocial character-"
