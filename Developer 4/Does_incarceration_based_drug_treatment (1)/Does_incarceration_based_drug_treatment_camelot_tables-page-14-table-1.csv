"were coded:
the presence of a mandatory aftercare component,

location"
"(prison or jail), length of treatment (more than 90 days or fewer than 90 days), nature"
"of participation (strictly voluntary vs at
least some non-voluntary participation), and"
"program maturity. These analyses found that none of the coded sample or treatment"
"characteristics displayed a statistically or substantively significant
relationship with"
"effect size. Perhaps the most striking finding from Table 3 is that nearly all of
the"
"mean odds ratios were statistically significant, which suggests that evidence of
the"
"effectiveness of TC programs
is
largely robust
to sample and program variations."
"Stated differently, participation in TC programs were associated with lower
rates of"
"re-offending, regardless of the age group, gender composition, offender type, use of"
"coercion to compel participation, and several other
factors."
"A parallel set of analyses was conducted for counseling programs (Tables 4 and 5)."
"Once more, most
evaluations were methodologically weak. Nearly three-quarters"
