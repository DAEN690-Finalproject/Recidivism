"Incarceration-based drug treatment
365"
"quasi-experiments (level 4) or
randomized experiments (level 5);
in comparison,
the"
"corresponding percentages for our research were 63% and 37%."
"A common concern when one is dealing with a body of research that
is generally"
"methodologically weak
is
that
this
research may
systematically
overestimate"
"treatment effects.
In other words, perhaps methodologically weak evaluations are"
"more likely to find treatment effects than are more rigorous evaluations. The research"
"of Weisburd
et
al.
(2001)
research
found
precisely
this
pattern
of
results. Our"
"synthesis of TC evaluations, however,
reveals a different pattern of
results. Table 2"
"indicates
that
the mean odds
ratios
for
the three highest
levels of method quality"
"were all statistically significant, indicating that the effectiveness of TC programs was"
"not confined to only methodologically weak evaluations. Further,
the methodolog-"
"ical quality variable was
statistically associated with effect
size;
all of
the
three"
"higher
levels of
rigor had mean effect
sizes
that were statistically larger
than the"
"lowest
level
of
rigor,
and
evaluations with
the
highest
level
of
rigor
differed"
"statistically from the three lower
levels. Thus, evaluations with the highest
level of"
"rigor produced the largest
treatment effects."
"Two additional methodological factors,
type of comparison group and publication"
"status,
had
a
statistically
significant
relationship
to
effect
size. Evaluations
that"
"formed the comparison group via random assignment had the largest odds
ratios,"
"whereas,
evaluations
that utilized
individuals who declined
to participate
in TC"
"treatment had the lowest odds
ratios. Post-hoc analyses
indicated that evaluations"
"composed
of
decliners
had
statistically
smaller
odds
ratios
than
did
the
other"
"comparison
groups,
and
evaluations
that
utilized
comparison
groups
formed
by"
"randomization had a larger mean odds ratio than did either evaluations that utilized a"
"comparison group of decliners, or offenders from other
jurisdictions/facilities. This"
"set
of
findings,
once
again,
suggests
that
evidence
of
the
effectiveness
of TC"
"programs is not confined to methodologically suspect evaluations (i.e., evaluations"
"that
utilized
comparison
group
composed
of
decliners
or
offenders
from other"
"jurisdictions/facilities or
time periods)."
"Another methodological characteristic that had a statistically significant associ-"
"ation with effect
size was publication status. Specifically, evaluations coded from"
"published
studies
exhibited
statistically larger
effect
sizes
than
evaluations
from"
"unpublished studies. This finding is an indication of publication bias in evaluations"
"of TC programs. As
a
further
test
for
the presence of publication bias
in these"
"evaluations, we
conducted
specialized
statistical
tests
for
publication
bias."
"Specifically, we conducted both the Begg and Mazumdar
(1994) and the Egger et"
"al.
(1997)
tests
for publication bias. The more
statistically powerful Egger
et
al."
"method found evidence of publication bias. Given this finding, we conducted Duvall"
"and Tweedie’s
(2000) “trim and fill” method for accounting for publication bias."
"This procedure added seven effect sizes to the distribution, which lowered the mean"
"random effects odds ratio to 1.21, with a 95% CI of 1.08 to 1.36 (Q=252.90, df=36,"
"p<0.001);
this
publication
bias-adjusted mean
odds
ratio
translates
into
a
re-"
"offending rate of approximately 45% for the treatment group, if we continue to make"
"the convenient assumption that 50% of
the comparison group re-offends."
"Table 3 presents the results of a similar bivariate analysis between the odds ratios"
"for
re-offending
and
sample/treatment
characteristics
for
the
odds
ratio
from"
"evaluations of TC programs. Three
sample
characteristic were
coded:
