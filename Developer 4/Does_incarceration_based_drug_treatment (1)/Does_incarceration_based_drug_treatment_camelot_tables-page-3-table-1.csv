"that were
specifically
targeted
at
substance
abusers,
intended
to
reduce
future"
"substance abuse and other criminal behaviors, and were based in a prison,
jail, or"
"analogous facility for juvenile offenders. Given this definition, program evaluations"
"fell
into five
types:
(1)
therapeutic
community (TC) programs,
(2) RSAT-funded"
"programs
(most
of which were
based
on
the TC model),
(3)
group
counseling"
"programs,
(4)
boot
camps
for
drug
offenders,
and
(5)
narcotic maintenance"
"programs."
"TCs are the most
intensive of all
incarceration-based drug treatment programs."
"While
the
components of TCs vary,
there
are
several
common components. TCs"
"house participants in a distinct
treatment unit away from the anti-social
influences of"
"the
general
correctional
environment
to
create
an
atmosphere
focused
on"
"rehabilitation and reformation. Another
core
component of
the TC model
is
that"
"participants are instrumentally involved in running the TC; for example, participants"
"lead treatment
sessions, monitor other
residents
for
rule compliance, maintain the"
"treatment unit, and resolve disputes. TCs have a confrontational nature in which both"
"staff
and
participants
openly
challenge
anti-social
behaviors
and
attitudes;
yet,"
"participants
also
are
supportive
of
each
others’
struggles
to make
pro-social"
"reformations. Many TCs
share a philosophy that
sees drug abuse as
symptomatic"
"of a broader personality disorder, and, consequently, many TCs focus on the larger"
"disorder and not
just drug abuse, per se (Kooyman 1993). Further, not only are TCs"
"intense
in nature but
they are
also long in duration—typically lasting at
least 6"
"months but usually around 12 months."
"RSAT-funded programs share several components with the TC model. Like TC"
"programs, RSAT-funded programs usually separate program participants
from the"
"general population;
they tend to be
intensive
and have
a
long duration (6 to 12"
"months
for prison-based programs, or at
least 3 months
for
jail-based programs)."
"Within
these
parameters,
local
corrections
agencies
control
the
content
of
such"
"programs. Our
review of
the extant
literature reveals that most of
the RSAT-funded"
"programs are based on the TC model. Thus,
in this review, RSAT-funded programs"
"are essentially TCs, but not all TCs are RSAT-funded programs."
"Counseling programs use various combinations of drug education, self-help 12-"
"step programming,
life skills training, and cognitive and behavioral skills training."
"The
key
commonality
among
these
programs
is
their
reliance
on
group-based"
"counseling approaches,
in which substance abuse and other common problems are"
"discussed among peers
in an effort
to solve these problems. Typically, counseling"
"programs are multi-faceted,
including several of
the above-mentioned components;"
"however,
some counseling programs heavily emphasize one of
these components."
"And still other counseling programs include both group and individual counseling."
"Boot
camps
are modeled
after military
basic
training.
Inmates
participate
in"
"rigorous exercise regimens,
learn military drill and ceremony, wear uniforms, and"
"take
on
challenge
courses
(timed
obstacle
courses). Boot
camps
are
highly"
"structured. From the moment
residents wake in the morning until
lights out
they"
"are
constantly
engaged
in
scheduled
activities.
Boots
camps
also
involve"
"considerable
confrontation,
but,
unlike TC programs,
confrontations most
often"
"occur between correctional staff and inmates—with drill
instructors disciplining any"
"deviation from established codes of conduct. Boot camp proponents claim that
the"
"harsh nature of boot camps serves as a deterrent
to future criminal conduct, and the"
