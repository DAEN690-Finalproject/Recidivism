"Incarceration-based drug treatment
361"
"indicated that
the treatment group re-offended less than the comparison group did."
"The random-effects mean odds ratio was 1.37, with a 95% confidence interval
(CI)"
"of 1.24 to 1.51. This finding indicates that,
in general, participation in incarceration-"
"based
drug
treatment
programs was
associated with
a
reduction
in
post-release"
"offending. A more intuitive sense of this effect size can be gained by translating this"
"effect size into percentages. As a matter of convenience, we assumed a 50% rate of"
"re-offending for
the comparison group. Given this assumption,
the overall means"
"odds
ratio translates
into a 42% re-offending rate
for
the
treatment group.2 The"
"distribution of
the odds ratios for offending exhibited considerably more variability"
"than expected by sampling error alone (Q=551.84, df=64, p<0.001). This finding"
"suggested that
features of
the
treatment programs,
research methodology,
and/or"
"characteristics
of
the
sample might
be
systematically
related
to
effect
size."
"Subsequent analyses tested this possibility."
"Examination of
the effect
for drug use produced a slightly smaller overall mean"
"effect size that was not statistically significant. The random-effects mean odds ratio"
"for
the 20 evaluations on drug use outcomes was 1.28 (95% CI of 0.92-1.78), and"
"there was more variability than expected by sampling error alone (Q=197.97 df=19,"
"p<0.001). Thus, with respect
to drug relapse,
the evidence suggests great variability"
"in effects across evaluations, and, overall, we cannot conclude that
these programs"
"are effective in reducing post-release drug use, although the evidence is positive."
"Moreover,
the
finding
of great variability in effects
suggests
that
there may
be"
"program or method
features
that
are
associated with
drug
relapse
effects;
for"
"example, perhaps participation in programs with long treatment durations do, in fact,"
"facilitate post-release reductions in drug use."
"Moderator analyses"
"The
above
analyses
indicated
that
the
effect
size
distributions
displayed more"
"variability than expected by chance alone. This finding suggested that
there may be"
"important differences
in research methodology,
sample,
and/or
interventions
that"
"may account for some of this variability in effect size. We tried to capture important"
"differences between evaluations by coding information from each evaluation. These"
"moderator analyses, however, were confronted with three major
issues. First, our"
"ability to code many relevant features was limited by the quality of the descriptions"
"provided
by
the
primary
authors.
Second,
the moderator
analyses
had
limited"
"statistical power. Post-hoc power analyses revealed that
the power
to detect a small"
"effect
(i.e., a difference in logged odds
ratio of 0.20)
in these moderator analyses"
"ranged from approximately 0.10 to 0.40. This
limited statistical power means
that"
"only contrasts with large effects were likely to be statistically significant. To combat"
"this
issue, we
interpreted
as
statistically
significant
any
contrast
that
had
a"
"probability
of
occurring
by
chance
alone
of
less
than
10% (i.e.,
p<0.10),
and,"
"instead
of
relying
solely
on
statistical
significance, we
discussed
substantively"
"significant effects. We defined “substantively significant” relationships based on the"
"2 Alternatively, we assumed a 35% re-offending rate for the comparison group, which was the average 12-"
"month re-offending rate. This effect size suggested a 28% rate of
re-offending for
the treatment group."
