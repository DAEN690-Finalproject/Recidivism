"Table 2 shows the zero-order correlation of each of the method variables with the"
"recidivism effect
sizes
(represented
as
logged
odds
ratios). These
are
inverse-"
"variance weighted,
random effects analyses with the random effects component"
"estimated using maximum likelihood techniques (Raudenbush 1994)."
"As Table 2 reports,
there was no signiﬁcant
relationship overall between the"
"effect sizes and the study design. In particular,
the effects observed in randomized"
"studies did not differ signiﬁcantly from those observed in matched studies or those"
"with comparison groups
that were neither matched nor
randomly assigned. Nor"
"was a signiﬁcant relationship observed for the coder’s rating of whether there was"
"an
evident
design
problem favoring
the
control
or
treatment
group,
that
is,"
"indications of nonequivalence that might affect
recidivism outcomes. Similarly,"
"there were
no
signiﬁcant
correlations with
the
attrition
proportion,
the way"
"recidivism was measured, or the interval over which it was measured."
"The
only methodological
variable
that
showed
a
signiﬁcant
( p
0.10)
G"
"relationship with
the
effect
size was whether
the
study
presented
the
treat-"
"mentYcontrol contrast as an intent-to-treat analysis. When the treatment dropouts"
"were included in the outcome recidivism,
the effect sizes were smaller than when"
"they were excluded, as would be expected. In light of this indication that the intent-"
"to-treat variable might
inﬂuence effect
sizes,
it was carried forward as a control"
"variable for
the analysis of
the relationships between effect sizes and substantive"
"factors
relating to the
treatment
and recipients. As
a
further precaution against"
"confounds with methodological characteristics,
the other
three method variables"
"with
zero-order
correlations
of
0.10
or
greater were
also
included
as method"
"controls (design problem, attrition proportion, and rearrest recidivism)."
"Effect size variation associated with the treatment and its recipients"
"The relationship between the recidivism effect
sizes and each of
the descriptive"
"variables
for CBT treatment and its
recipients
(see listing in Table 1) was next"
"examined with the
four
selected method variables
included as
controls. These"
"analyses were conducted with a set of
random effects multiple regressions
that"
"included a descriptive variable
and the
four
control variables. These were
run"
"separately for each descriptive variable in this
initial analysis
to ensure that any"
"having potentially important
relationships with effect size were identiﬁed despite"
"whatever
correlations
they had with other variables
in the
set. Because of
the"
"modest
number
of
studies
and
the
broad
conﬁdence
intervals
associated with"
"random effects analysis, alpha = 0.10 was set as the threshold for statistical signi-"
"ﬁcance. Table 3 presents the results."
"The variables
in Table 3 are grouped into categories
that
represent different"
"aspects of
the
studies
and the nature of
the CBT treatment
studied. The most"
"general study characteristics (country,
type of publication, and date of publication)"
"showed no signiﬁcant relationships with effect size. The other candidate moderator"
"variables are grouped according to a simple model
that assumes that, with method"
"variables controlled,
treatment effects will be a function of
the characteristics of"
