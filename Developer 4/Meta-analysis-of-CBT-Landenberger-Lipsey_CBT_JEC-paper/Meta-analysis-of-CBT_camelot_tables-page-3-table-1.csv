"EFFECTS OF CBT FOR OFFENDERS

"offered or
is combined with other
services, e.g., educational classes, vocational"
"training, or mental health counseling."
"Factors
related to program implementation that might
inﬂuence the effects of"
"CBT include, most centrally, how much treatment
is provided. The duration of"
"CBT programs in correctional settings, for instance, varies from weeks to years and"
"may involve many meetings per week or
less
than one. The ﬁdelity of
the im-"
"plementation to the curriculum speciﬁcations may also be important along with the"
"degree of expertise possessed by the personnel providing the program. As men-"
"tioned earlier, Lipsey and Landenberger (2005) found that programs implemented"
"principally
for
research
or
demonstration
purposes
showed
larger
effects
than"
"routine practice programs. In these programs,
the researchers themselves generally"
"exercise
control
over
the
various
phases
and
facets
of
implementation. The"
"treatment provided to offenders in those circumstances almost certainly differs in"
"important ways from that provided when the program under everyday conditions in"
"criminal
justice settings."
"Among the characteristics of
the offenders participating in CBT that may in-"
"ﬂuence the outcome are age, gender, and ethnic background as well as criminal"
"history and other such risk indicators. The Frisk principle_ of Andrews et al. (1990),"
"for
instance, posits
that effective treatment will have greater
impact on higher-"
"risk offenders
because
they have more
room for
improvement
than lower-risk"
"offenders."
"Finally, there is good reason to believe that
the methods and procedures used in"
"the
research will
inﬂuence
the magnitude
of
the
observed
effects. Random"
"assignment
studies
are
expected
to
yield
unbiased
results while ﬁndings
from"
"nonrandomized
comparisons may
over
or
understate
effects. Weisburd
et
al."
"(2001),
for
example,
found larger
effects
in nonrandomized studies of
criminal"
"justice programs though, for CBT, Pearson et al. (2002) reported larger effects for"
"studies of higher methodological quality. After assignment
to conditions, attrition"
"from outcome measurement can also bias effect estimates if, as is likely,
it
is not"
"randomly
distributed
across
conditions. The
operationalization
of
the
outcome"
"measure
is
another potential
source of difference. Even when the
focus
is on"
"recidivism,
some
studies
index it with the
rate of
rearrest, others by assessing"
"reconvictions,
incarcerations, probation or parole violations, and the like. More-"
"over,
the timing of recidivism measurement varies, ranging from a period close to"
"the end of
treatment
to months or years later."
"Purpose of
this meta-analysis"
"The objective of
this meta-analysis
is
to examine
the
relationships of
selected"
"moderator variables to the effects of CBT on the recidivism of adult and juvenile"
"offenders.
In order
to have a sufﬁcient number of
studies
to permit examination"
"of
between-study
differences,
an
especially
thorough
search was made
of
the"
"available research. To assist
in expanding the number of
studies, and to ensure"
