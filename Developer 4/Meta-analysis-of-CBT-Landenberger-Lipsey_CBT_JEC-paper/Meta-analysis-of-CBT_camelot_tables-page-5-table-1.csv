"EFFECTS OF CBT FOR OFFENDERS
455"
"Research methods"
"The study used a randomized or quasi-experimental design that compared a CBT"
"treatment condition with a control condition that did not
include CBT treatment."
"Quasi-experimental designs were
eligible only if
subjects
in the
treatment
and"
"control conditions were matched or statistically controlled on pre-treatment
risk-"
"related variables
(e.g.,
relevant personal, demographic, and criminal background"
"characteristics) or
if pre-treatment measures of criminal or antisocial behavior or"
"signiﬁcant
risk factors
for
such behavior were reported in a form that permitted"
"assessment
of
the
initial
equivalence
of
the
treatment
and
control
groups. To"
"eliminate explicit self-selection as a biasing factor
in group assignment, however,"
"studies were not
included if the control groups were created with individuals who"
"began CBT but dropped out prior
to completing treatment or who were offered"
"CBT and refused. Control groups could represent placebo, wait-list, no treatment,"
"or
conditions, with the
latter
restricted to cases of
clearly
Ftreatment
as usual_"
"routine probation,
institutional, or aftercare/parole practices."
"Source"
"Both published and unpublished studies were eligible for
inclusion, conducted in"
"any country, and reported in any language."
"Search strategy"
"An initial set of eligible studies came from those assembled and analyzed for
the"
"Lipsey et
al.
(2001)
and Lipsey and Landenberger
(2005) meta-analyses. This"
"number was
expanded
through
a
comprehensive
search
using
the
following"
"procedures."
"Meta-analysis databases"
"The second author has constructed a meta-analysis database of coded studies for"
"interventions with juvenile offenders based on a comprehensive search for studies"
"reported in 2002 or
earlier. All
the
studies
in that database were
reviewed for"
"eligibility and an independent
search was conducted for
studies published after"
"2002.
In addition,
the studies
in a database of
interventions with adult offenders"
"that
is nearing completion were reviewed for eligibility."
"Database searches"
"Computerized
bibliography
searches were
conducted
for
studies
reported
from"
"1965 through 2005. To the best of our knowledge,
the ﬁrst systematic applications"
"of CBT to
offenders were
developed
and
published
in
the mid-1970s
(e.g.,"
"Yochelson and Samenow 1976); searching back to 1965 was aimed at ensuring that"
"none were missed. The keywords
for
searching were
concatenations
of words"
"describing the population (e.g., inmates, offenders), CBT treatment (e.g., cognitive,"
"CBT, criminal
thinking), and effectiveness
research (e.g., outcomes, evaluation,"
"effectiveness).
The
databases
searched
included
the Campbell Collaboration"
"Social,
Psychological,
Educational
and Criminological
Trials Register
