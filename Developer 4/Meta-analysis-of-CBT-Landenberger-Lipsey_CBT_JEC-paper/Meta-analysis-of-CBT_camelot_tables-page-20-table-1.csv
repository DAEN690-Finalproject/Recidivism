"Discussion"
"This meta-analysis
conﬁrmed
the ﬁndings
of
positive CBT effects
on
the
re-"
"cidivism of offenders that have been reported in other recent meta-analyses (Lipsey"
"et al. 2001; Lipsey and Landenberger
(2005); Pearson et al. 2002; Wilson et al."
"2005). The mean odds ratio indicated that
the odds of not
recidivating in the 12"
"months after intervention for individuals in the treatment group were 1.53 times as"
"great as those for individuals in the control group. This represents a reduction from"
"the 0.40 mean recidivism rate of the control groups to a mean rate of 0.30 for the"
"treatment
groups,
a
25% decrease. The most
effective
conﬁgurations
of CBT"
"produced
odds
ratios
nearly
twice
as
large
as
the mean,
corresponding
to
re-"
"cidivism rates of around 0.19 in the treatment groups, more than a 50% decrease"
"from the 0.40 rate of
the average control group."
"The main emphasis of
this meta-analysis, however, was
the
search for key"
"moderator
variables
that would
distinguish
situations
in which CBT produced"
"larger effects
from those in which it produced smaller ones. On this
issue,
there"
"are two themes in the ﬁndings. First, a number of variables characterizing the sub-"
"ject samples, amount and implementation of CBT, and the CBT treatment elements"
"were signiﬁcantly correlated with the effect sizes for recidivism outcomes. In this"
"regard,
there are numerous moderators of
the treatment effects. These are not all"
"independent relationships, however. Intervention studies tend to come with bundles"
"of co-occurring characteristics that are,
therefore, correlated with each other across"
"studies. This confounding of moderator variables with each other makes it difﬁcult"
"to identify those most critical
to the outcome (Lipsey 2003)."
"Application of multiple regression analysis to identify the moderator variables"
"with the strongest
independent relationships to effect size led to the second theme"
"in
our
ﬁndings. Of
the many
study
characteristics
that
showed
signiﬁcant"
"relationships with
effect
size,
relatively
few remained
signiﬁcant when
the"
"inﬂuence of
the others was
taken into account. The net
result was
that much of"
"the
variation
in
recidivism effects
could
be
explained
by
a
small
number
of"
"moderator variables. The only factors independently related to the effect sizes were"
"(a)
the risk level of
the participating offenders,
(b) how well
the treatment was"
"implemented, and (c) the presence or absence of a few treatment elements. In the"
"latter
category,
inclusion
of
anger
control
and
interpersonal
problem solving"
"components in the treatment program were associated with larger effects; inclusion"
"of victim impact and behavior modiﬁcation were associated with smaller effects."
"Most
striking was
that, controlled for other moderators, none of
the major CBT"
"brand name programs produced effects on recidivism that were signiﬁcantly larger"
"than the average effects of
the other programs."
"Though not
informative
for purposes of
identifying the most
effective
treat-"
"ment
conditions,
the
relationships between characteristics of
the
study methods"
"and the effects
sizes were nonetheless
interesting. The aspect of method that
is"
"usually of greatest concern for intervention studies is whether a randomized design"
"was used. For
the studies included in this meta-analysis, however,
there were no"
"signiﬁcant
effect
size
differences
between
randomized
and nonrandomized
