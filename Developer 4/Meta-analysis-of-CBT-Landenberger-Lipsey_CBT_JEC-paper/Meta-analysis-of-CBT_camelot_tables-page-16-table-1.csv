"between treatment while incarcerated and treatment
in the community (e.g.,
for"
"probationers and parolees); this variable was not signiﬁcantly related to effect size."
"The extent
to which CBT was emphasized in the treatment program, on the other"
"hand, did show a signiﬁcant relationship. That variable ranged across categories of"
"CBT supplemented by other services, CBT with some other treatment elements, and"
"CBT alone. As the negative sign on the coefﬁcient
in Table 3 shows,
the effects are"
"signiﬁcantly larger when CBT is combined with other services. Examples of such"
"components include mental health counseling, employment and vocational
training,"
"and educational programs."
"Speciﬁc nature of
the CBT treatment"
"The last
two sections of Table 3 show two alternative ways of
representing the"
"speciﬁc nature of
the CBT treatment provided. One set of dummy-coded items"
"differentiates the various major named types of CBT along with a somewhat more"
"generic category of CBT programs focusing on substance abuse and two residual"
"categories of less common but manualized treatments and a few that do not appear"
"to be manualized. None of these program variables is signiﬁcantly related to effect"
"size, meaning that no brand of CBT produces
effects
that
stand out
from the"
"average of
the other brands."
"The other way we coded CBT treatment was in terms of
the speciﬁc treatment"
"elements
identiﬁed in the descriptions provided in the study reports. Those de-"
"scriptions varied in detail and extensiveness but when they mentioned a distinct"
"treatment element, we coded it as present using a dummy code. The elements that"
"appeared with sufﬁcient
frequency to support analysis are shown in Table 3, de-"

"thinking and decision-making skills such
