"Cross-referencing of bibliographies"
"Relevant
review articles, meta-analyses,
and

studies
reviewed
for"
"eligibility were scanned for citations to potentially eligible studies."
"Internet searches"
"Relevant government websites
(e.g., NIJ, NIC, OJJDP, Home Ofﬁce) as well as"
"foundation,
professional
associations
and
policy
research
ﬁrm websites were"
"searched. In addition, keyword searches were conducted using search engines such"
"as google.com."
"Journals"
"Vanderbilt University subscribes to a large number of electronic journals and the"
"full
text of
those
judged relevant was
searched with selected keywords. Major"
"journals publishing empirical studies related to crime and delinquency were also"
"hand searched for eligible studies."
"Informal sources"
"Unpublished results from evaluations of
two CBT programs were available from"
"the ﬁrst author, and several colleagues alerted us to eligible studies that were not"
"accessible through the above channels."
"The search for CBT studies on adult offenders produced 2,947 study citations"
"with 771 reports judged promising enough to retrieve for closer examination. The"
"search for juvenile offender studies produced 1,487 study citations with 299 reports"
"retrieved. Review of
the retrieved studies ultimately identiﬁed 58 studies meeting"
"the criteria for inclusion in the present meta-analysis."
"Data management and extraction"
"Descriptive and outcome data were coded for each of the 58 eligible studies using"
"a coding protocol developed speciﬁcally for this purpose. Table 1, presented later,"
"shows
the major coding categories used for descriptive information. Recidivism"
"outcomes were reported in several different
forms but,
in virtually all
instances,"
"either the proportions of offenders in each research condition that recidivated were"
"speciﬁed or
information was provided from which the proportions could be esti-"
"mated. When more than one recidivism outcome was reported, only one was se-"
"lected
for
analysis
using
criteria
that maximized
cross-study
similarity
on
the"
"variables and times of measurement. This procedure favored rearrest
recidivism,"
"then reconviction and incarceration in that order, and the measure taken closest
to"
"12 months post-treatment."
