"Abstract. A meta-analysis
of
58
experimental
and
quasi-experimental
studies
of
the
effects
of"
"cognitive-behavioral
therapy (CBT) on the recidivism of adult and juvenile offenders conﬁrmed prior"
"positive ﬁndings
and
explored
a
range
of
potential moderators
to
identify
factors
associated with"
"variation in treatment effects. With method variables controlled,
the factors independently associated"
"with larger
recidivism reductions were treatment of higher
risk offenders, high quality treatment
im-"
"plementation, and a CBT program that included anger control and interpersonal problem solving but not"
"victim impact or behavior modiﬁcation components. With these factors accounted for,
there was no"
"difference in the effectiveness of different brand name CBT programs or generic forms of CBT."

"Several well-conducted meta-analyses have identiﬁed cognitive-behavioral therapy"
"(CBT)
as
a
particularly
effective
intervention
for
reducing
the
recidivism of"
"juvenile and adult offenders. Pearson et al. (2002), for instance, conducted a meta-"
"analysis
of
69
research
studies
covering
both
behavioral
(e.g.,
contingency"
"contracting,
token economy) and cognitive-behavioral programs. They found that"
"the cognitiveYbehavioral programs were more effective in reducing recidivism than"
"the behavioral ones, with a mean recidivism reduction for treated groups of about"
"30%. Similarly, a meta-analysis by Wilson et al.
(2005) examined 20 studies of"
"group-oriented cognitive behavioral programs
for offenders and found that CBT"
"was
very
effective
for
reducing
their
criminal
behavior.
In
their
analysis,"
"representative CBT programs showed recidivism reductions of 20Y30% compared"
"to control groups."
"Although these meta-analyses provide strong indications of the effectiveness of"
"cognitiveYbehavioral
treatment
for
offenders,
they
encompassed
considerable"
"diversity within the range of offender
types, outcome variables, quality of
study"
"design, and (especially in Pearson et al. 2002) variations in what was counted as a"
"cognitiveYbehavioral treatment. A more circumscribed meta-analysis conducted by"
"Lipsey et al. (2001) examined 14 experimental and quasi-experimental studies that"
"emphasized cognitive change as
the deﬁning condition of CBT, considered only"
"effects
for general offender
samples, and focused on reoffense recidivism as
the"
"treatment outcome. The results showed that
the odds of recidivating for offenders"
"receiving CBT were only about 55% of that for offenders in control groups. Lipsey"
