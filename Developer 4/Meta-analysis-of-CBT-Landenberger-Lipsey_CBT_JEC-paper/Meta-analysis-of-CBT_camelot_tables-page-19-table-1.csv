"EFFECTS OF CBT FOR OFFENDERS
469"
"previously designated for
that purpose Y sessions per week,
length in weeks, and"
"their
interaction. The quality of
the CBT implementation was represented by the"
"composite
implementation factor,
also described earlier. The
type of CBT was"
"represented in the ﬁrst analysis as the set of brand name categories (with the two"
"In the second it was represented in
Fother_ categories omitted as a reference set)."
"terms of the speciﬁc treatment elements identiﬁed as present in the intervention. In"
"both analyses,
the CBT emphasis variable was also included to add information"
"about
the primacy of CBT in the overall
intervention."
"Table
5
shows
the
results when
the CBT was
represented
in
brand
name"
"categories. Once again, no speciﬁc type of CBT program had effects signiﬁcantly"
"different
from the mean of
all
the
other
types. Only
two moderator
variables"
"were
individually signiﬁcant
in this
analysis Y recidivism risk (higher
risk was"
"associated with larger
effects) and the composite implementation factor
(higher"
"quality implementation was associated with larger effects)."
"Table 6 shows
the parallel analysis with the CBT intervention represented in"
"terms of treatment elements. As in the previous analysis, recidivism risk and high"
"quality implementation were associated with better outcomes.
In addition, how-"
"ever,
four of
the
individual
treatment
elements
showed signiﬁcant
relationships"
"with effect size.
Interpersonal problem solving and anger control were positively"
"related;
their presence was
associated with larger
effects on recidivism. Victim"
"impact and behavior modiﬁcation were negatively related;
they were associated"
"with worse outcomes."
"Effects of
FBest practice_ CBT on recidivism"
"We can use the multiple regression analysis
in Table 6 to explore optimal CBT"
"treatment
circumstances
by
predicting
the
effect
size
expected
in
a
favorable"
"scenario.
For
this
purpose we
assumed
the
best
quality
study method
and"
"measurement
characteristics
(no
design
problems,
zero
attrition,
intent-to-treat"
"analysis, and an arrest
recidivism outcome). We also assumed the subject sample"
"was comprised of moderately high risk offenders who received the median number"
"of
sessions per week (two) with high quality implementation over
the median"
"number of weeks
(16). The CBT treatment
assumed was any one of
the brand"
"name
programs
alone
(not
supplemented with
other
services),
but with
anger"
"control and interpersonal problem-solving components included."
"When the corresponding variable values are entered into the prediction equation"
"represented in Table 6,
the predicted effect
size is a logged odds
ratio of 1.05,"
"corresponding to an odds
ratio of 2.86. Compared to a control group recidivism"
"of 0.40 (the overall mean),
this represents a decrease to a recidivism rate of 0.19"
"in the treatment group,
that
is, a 52% decrease overall. This impressive effect
is"
"not a mathematical projection beyond what appears in the data. An odds ratio of"
"2.86 is at
the 82nd percentile of the distribution of effects for the 58 studies in this"
"meta-analysis."
