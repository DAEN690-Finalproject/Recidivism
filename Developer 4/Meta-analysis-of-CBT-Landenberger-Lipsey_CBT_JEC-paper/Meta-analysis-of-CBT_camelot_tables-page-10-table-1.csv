"The selected recidivism outcomes were coded as odds
ratios
representing the"
"odds of Fsuccess_ (not recidivating) for treatment group participants relative to the"
"odds for control participants. For binary outcomes, the odds ratio provides an effect"
"size statistic that has
favorable properties and yields
readily interpretable results"
"(Haddock et al. 1998). Statistical analysis with odds ratios is facilitated if they are"
"represented by their
log,
so the
logged odds
ratios were used in all
analyses."
"Otherwise,
the statistical analysis was conducted using conventional meta-analysis"
"techniques (Lipsey and Wilson 2001) with each effect size weighted by its inverse"
"variance in random effects analyses."
"Results"
"Table 1 summarizes
the
characteristics of
the 58 studies
included in the meta-"
"analysis.
Several
features
of
this
research
are
notable. Randomized
designs,"
"matched designs,
and group comparisons using neither of
these procedures
are"
"represented in roughly equal numbers and involve a wide range of sample sizes."
"Attrition from outcome measurement
is virtually zero in a majority of
the studies"
"but
ranges over 30% in some of
the
remaining ones. About half
the programs"
"studied were
implemented
as
routine
practice with
the
other
half
set
up
and"
"implemented by researchers as either demonstration or
research programs, with"
"demonstration programs deﬁned as
those mounted mainly for
research purposes"
"but at a scale and in a manner
somewhat more representative of actual practice"
"than those categorized as
research programs. More studies were conducted with"
"adult
than juvenile offenders and most used only or predominately male offenders."
"Treatment was administered while the offenders were incarcerated in a correctional"
"institution in nearly half
the studies and generally lasted less
than 20 weeks.
In"
"most
instances,
the
treatment
providers
had
little
or
no
evident mental
health"
"background and had received relatively minimal
training in cognitive behavioral"
"therapy. The treatment was
typically one of
the Fbrand name_ manualized CBT"
"programs and incorporated multiple treatment elements."
"Effect size variation associated with study methods"
"The mean odds ratio representing the average effect of intervention was 1.53 ( p G"
"0.001),
indicating that
the odds of success (no recidivism in the post-intervention"
"interval of approximately 12 months)
for
individuals in the treatment group were"
"more than one and a half
times as great as
those for
individuals
in the control"
"group. In relation to the mean recidivism rate for the control groups of about 0.40,"
"this odds
ratio indicates a recidivism reduction of 25% to 0.30. There was also"
"signiﬁcant variation across studies in the odds ratio for
intervention effects (Q ="

"The
recidivism effects
observed
in
the
studies
in
this meta-analysis
are"
"potentially inﬂuenced by both the methodological characteristics of
the studies"
