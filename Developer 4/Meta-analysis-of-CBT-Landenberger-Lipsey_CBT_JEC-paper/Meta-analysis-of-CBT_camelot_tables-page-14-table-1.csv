"Participant characteristics"
"Of
the characteristics of
the treatment
recipients
that could be coded from most"
"studies, only the recidivism risk rating was signiﬁcantly related to the effect sizes."
"This rating was made by the coder on the basis of
the description in the study of"
"the criminal history of the treated offenders and the recidivism rate of the control"
"group. That
rating,
in turn, was not signiﬁcantly correlated with any of
the other"
"variables describing the participants shown in Table 3. It
is worth noting that
there"
"was no relationship between effect
size and whether
the treated offenders were"
"juveniles
or
adults. The
gender mix
of
the CBT recipients
also
showed
no"
"relationship to effect size but, as Table 1 shows, most of the samples were all male"
"or predominately male so there was little variation on this measure."
"Amount of CBT"
"Dosage variables were coded as the number of sessions per week,
the number of"
"hours of treatment per week, the total hours of treatment, and the number of weeks"
"of
treatment
from beginning to end (see Table 1). The distributions for
the latter"
"three had long tails
and the
logged values of
these variables were used in the"
"analysis
(and
showed
stronger
relationships
to
effect
size
than
the
unlogged"
"versions). As Table 3 shows, all
these variables except
length of
treatment were"
"signiﬁcantly
related
to
effect
size.
Total
hours, which
showed
the
largest"
"relationship, however,
is a function of both the number of hours per week and"
"the number of weeks. The study-level correlations among these variables showed"
"that
length of treatment was signiﬁcantly related to total hours (r = 0.51)
as were"
"the number of sessions per week (r = 0.58) and number of hours per week (r ="
"0.75), with the latter
two being highly correlated with each other
(r = 0.81)."
"From this pattern of
relationships we concluded that
the best
representation of"
"the amount of
treatment
should distinguish the number of
sessions or hours per"
"week from the length of
the treatment. That approach allows further examination"
"of the ﬁnding in Table 3 that number of sessions and hours per week are related to"
"the
effect
size
but,
apparently,
the
duration
of
treatment
is
not. Between
the"
"number
of
sessions
per week
and
the
number
of
hours,
