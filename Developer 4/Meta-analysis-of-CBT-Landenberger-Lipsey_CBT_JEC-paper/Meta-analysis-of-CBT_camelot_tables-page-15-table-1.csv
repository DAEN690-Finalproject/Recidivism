"stronger
relationship to effect
size. Table 3 also shows
the
interaction between"
"number of sessions and length of
treatment, but
it was not signiﬁcantly related to"
"effect size."
"Quality of CBT implementation"
"In
this
category we
include
the
practice-research
dimension
that
distinguishes"
"between CBT treatments
implemented on a routine basis
in real-world criminal"
"justice
contexts,
demonstration
programs
in
similar
circumstances
but with"
"signiﬁcant
inﬂuence by the
researcher,
and research programs
implemented by"
"the
researchers
largely
for
research
purposes. Our
assumption
is
that
the"
"progressively greater
involvement of
researchers translates into better
implemen-"
"tation and more ﬁdelity to the treatment protocol."
"Table 4 shows that
the study-level correlations were all signiﬁcant between the"
"practice-research variable and the other variables assumed related to implemen-"
"tation quality listed in Table 3 Y proportion of dropouts from treatment, extent of"
"implementation monitoring
reported,
amount
of CBT
training
indicated
for"
"providers,
and
the mental
health
background
of
the
providers. Table
3
shows"
"relationships
in
the
expected
direction with
effect
size
for
all
these
variables"
"except
providers’ mental
health
background,
though
only
proportion
of
treat-"
"ment dropouts and the practice-research dimension reached statistical signiﬁcance."
"To summarize the relationship of
these implementation quality variables to effect"
"size, a composite variable was created in the form of a factor score from a principal"
"components analysis. As shown in Table 3, that composite implementation factor is"
"more strongly related to the effect sizes than any of the component variables."
"Other program characteristics"
"Table 3 also shows
the relationship between effect
size and two other program"
"characteristics. One is the setting within which CBT was provided, differentiated"
"Table 4. Correlations between potential moderator variables related to the quality of CBT implemen-"
"tation (N = 58)."
