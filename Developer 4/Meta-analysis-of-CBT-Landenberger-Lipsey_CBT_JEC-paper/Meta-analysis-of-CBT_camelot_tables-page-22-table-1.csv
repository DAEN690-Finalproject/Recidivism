"six of the random assignment studies were conducted on Freal world_ CBT practice;"
"the others were research and demonstration programs. The amount of high quality"
"research on CBT in representative correctional practice is not yet
large enough to"
"determine whether the impressive effects on recidivism found in this meta-analysis"
"can be routinely attained under everyday circumstances."
"Though generalization to routine practice cannot be assured,
the consistency"
"and magnitude of
the effects found in the research to date leave little doubt
that"
"CBT is capable of producing signiﬁcant reductions in the recidivism of even high"
"risk offenders under
favorable conditions. However, much remains to be learned"
"about
the optimal conﬁguration of CBT and the conditions under which it
is most"
"effective.
In this meta-analysis we
coded as much detail
as possible
about
the"
"program characteristics and context from the descriptions provided in the research"
"reports. At best,
those descriptions were limited and fell well
short of providing"
"full
information about critical program details. An important direction for
future"
"research is to better differentiate and document
the dimensions along which CBT"
"varies in different applications and to identify the characteristics most critical
for"
"attaining optimal
effects. The
central
issue
for
research on CBT with offender"
"populations at
this
juncture is not
to determine if
it has positive effects, but
to"
"determine when and why it has the most positive effects."
