then focused further on an updated and overlapping set"
"of
14
randomized
experiments
and
found
that
the mean
recidivism for
the"
"treatment groups in those studies was 27% lower than that of the control groups."
"Variation in effectiveness"
"Meta-analysis has thus consistently indicated that CBT, on average, has signiﬁcant"
"positive effects on recidivism. However,
there is also signiﬁcant variation across"
"studies
in
the
effect
sizes
that
contribute
to
those mean
values
that must
be"
"acknowledged.
Identiﬁcation of
the moderator variables
that describe
the
study"
"characteristics associated with larger and smaller effects
is another kind of con-"
"tribution meta-analysis can make to understanding the effectiveness of CBT with"
"offenders. Of particular importance is the role such moderator analysis can play in"
"ascertaining which variants of CBT are most effective and for which offenders."
"Lipsey and Landenberger
(2005)
identiﬁed a few factors
that were related to"
"variation in recidivism effects. They found that
treatment of high risk offenders,"
"greater
levels of CBT training for
treatment providers, and CBT programs set up"
"for research or demonstration purposes (in contrast
to Freal world_ routine practice"
"programs) were associated with larger effects. What most characterized the research"
"and demonstration programs,
in turn, was smaller sample sizes, greater monitoring"
"of offender attendance and adherence to the intervention plan (treatment ﬁdelity"
"checks), and providers with mental health backgrounds. These factors suggest
that"
"treatment effectiveness is mainly a function of the quality of the CBT provided."
"That meta-analysis involved only a small number of studies, however, and did"
"not permit much exploration of potential moderator variables. Wilson et al. (2005)"
"computed mean effect
sizes
separately for Moral Reconation Therapy
(MRT),"
"Reasoning and Rehabilitation (R&R), and Fother_ CBT programs. They found that"
"R&R showed somewhat
smaller mean
effects, but
did not
examine
any other"
"moderator variables. Pearson et al. (2002), as noted above, compared the effects of"
"behavioral and cognitiveYbehavioral programs and also reported larger effects for"
"better designed studies, but did not pursue further moderator analysis."
"There has
thus been only limited meta-analytic investigation of
factors
iden-"
"tiﬁable in the body of
research on CBT that are associated with variation in its"
"effects on offender recidivism. The most likely candidates for such factors fall into"
"categories
relating to the speciﬁc type of CBT program applied,
the nature and"
"extent of
its
implementation,
the
characteristics of
the offenders
to whom it
is"
"provided, and the study methods used to investigate its effects."
"The
type
of CBT program,
for
instance,
relates, ﬁrst,
to
the
Fbrand
name_"
"curriculum used,
such as MRT and R&R as examined by Wilson et al.
(2005)."
"CBT programs also differ
in the nature and mix of
treatment elements included,"
"e.g., whether oriented mainly toward cognitive restructuring exercises or cognitive"
"skills training and whether such topics as anger management,
relapse prevention,"
"interpersonal
problem solving
and moral
reasoning
are
covered. Another
po-"
"tentially important distinction is whether CBT constitutes virtually the full program"
