Abstract. A meta-analysis of 58 experimental and quasi-experimental studies of the effects of
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) on the recidivism of adult and juvenile offenders conﬁrmed prior
positive ﬁndings and explored a range of potential moderators to identify factors associated with
variation in treatment effects. With method variables controlled, the factors independently associated
with larger recidivism reductions were treatment of higher risk offenders, high quality treatment im-
plementation, and a CBT program that included anger control and interpersonal problem solving but not
victim impact or behavior modiﬁcation components. With these factors accounted for, there was no
difference in the effectiveness of different brand name CBT programs or generic forms of CBT.
Key words: CBT, cognitive-behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral treatment, criminal rehabilitation,
evaluation, meta-analysis, offenders, recidivism, treatment effectiveness
Several well-conducted meta-analyses have identiﬁed cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT) as a particularly effective intervention for reducing the recidivism of
juvenile and adult offenders. Pearson et al. (2002), for instance, conducted a meta-
analysis of 69 research studies covering both behavioral (e.g., contingency
contracting, token economy) and cognitive-behavioral programs. They found that
the cognitiveYbehavioral programs were more effective in reducing recidivism than
the behavioral ones, with a mean recidivism reduction for treated groups of about
30%. Similarly, a meta-analysis by Wilson et al. (2005) examined 20 studies of
group-oriented cognitive behavioral programs for offenders and found that CBT
was very effective for reducing their criminal behavior. In their analysis,
representative CBT programs showed recidivism reductions of 20Y30% compared
to control groups.
Although these meta-analyses provide strong indications of the effectiveness of
cognitiveYbehavioral treatment for offenders, they encompassed considerable
diversity within the range of offender types, outcome variables, quality of study
design, and (especially in Pearson et al. 2002) variations in what was counted as a
cognitiveYbehavioral treatment. A more circumscribed meta-analysis conducted by
Lipsey et al. (2001) examined 14 experimental and quasi-experimental studies that
emphasized cognitive change as the deﬁning condition of CBT, considered only
effects for general offender samples, and focused on reoffense recidivism as the
treatment outcome. The results showed that the odds of recidivating for offenders
receiving CBT were only about 55% of that for offenders in control groups. Lipsey

and Landenberger (2005) then focused further on an updated and overlapping set
of 14 randomized experiments and found that the mean recidivism for the
treatment groups in those studies was 27% lower than that of the control groups.
Variation in effectiveness
Meta-analysis has thus consistently indicated that CBT, on average, has signiﬁcant
positive effects on recidivism. However, there is also signiﬁcant variation across
studies in the effect sizes that contribute to those mean values that must be
acknowledged. Identiﬁcation of the moderator variables that describe the study
characteristics associated with larger and smaller effects is another kind of con-
tribution meta-analysis can make to understanding the effectiveness of CBT with
offenders. Of particular importance is the role such moderator analysis can play in
ascertaining which variants of CBT are most effective and for which offenders.
Lipsey and Landenberger (2005) identiﬁed a few factors that were related to
variation in recidivism effects. They found that treatment of high risk offenders,
greater levels of CBT training for treatment providers, and CBT programs set up
for research or demonstration purposes (in contrast to Freal world_ routine practice
programs) were associated with larger effects. What most characterized the research
and demonstration programs, in turn, was smaller sample sizes, greater monitoring
of offender attendance and adherence to the intervention plan (treatment ﬁdelity
checks), and providers with mental health backgrounds. These factors suggest that
treatment effectiveness is mainly a function of the quality of the CBT provided.
That meta-analysis involved only a small number of studies, however, and did
not permit much exploration of potential moderator variables. Wilson et al. (2005)
computed mean effect sizes separately for Moral Reconation Therapy (MRT),
Reasoning and Rehabilitation (R&R), and Fother_ CBT programs. They found that
R&R showed somewhat smaller mean effects, but did not examine any other
moderator variables. Pearson et al. (2002), as noted above, compared the effects of
behavioral and cognitiveYbehavioral programs and also reported larger effects for
better designed studies, but did not pursue further moderator analysis.
There has thus been only limited meta-analytic investigation of factors iden-
tiﬁable in the body of research on CBT that are associated with variation in its
effects on offender recidivism. The most likely candidates for such factors fall into
categories relating to the speciﬁc type of CBT program applied, the nature and
extent of its implementation, the characteristics of the offenders to whom it is
provided, and the study methods used to investigate its effects.
The type of CBT program, for instance, relates, ﬁrst, to the Fbrand name_
curriculum used, such as MRT and R&R as examined by Wilson et al. (2005).
CBT programs also differ in the nature and mix of treatment elements included,
e.g., whether oriented mainly toward cognitive restructuring exercises or cognitive
skills training and whether such topics as anger management, relapse prevention,
interpersonal problem solving and moral reasoning are covered. Another po-
tentially important distinction is whether CBT constitutes virtually the full program
NANA A. LANDENBERGER AND MARK W. LIPSEY
452

offered or is combined with other services, e.g., educational classes, vocational
training, or mental health counseling.
Factors related to program implementation that might inﬂuence the effects of
CBT include, most centrally, how much treatment is provided. The duration of
CBT programs in correctional settings, for instance, varies from weeks to years and
may involve many meetings per week or less than one. The ﬁdelity of the im-
plementation to the curriculum speciﬁcations may also be important along with the
degree of expertise possessed by the personnel providing the program. As men-
tioned earlier, Lipsey and Landenberger (2005) found that programs implemented
principally for research or demonstration purposes showed larger effects than
routine practice programs. In these programs, the researchers themselves generally
exercise control over the various phases and facets of implementation. The
treatment provided to offenders in those circumstances almost certainly differs in
important ways from that provided when the program under everyday conditions in
criminal justice settings.
Among the characteristics of the offenders participating in CBT that may in-
ﬂuence the outcome are age, gender, and ethnic background as well as criminal
history and other such risk indicators. The Frisk principle_ of Andrews et al. (1990),
for instance, posits that effective treatment will have greater impact on higher-
risk offenders because they have more room for improvement than lower-risk
offenders.
Finally, there is good reason to believe that the methods and procedures used in
the research will inﬂuence the magnitude of the observed effects. Random
assignment studies are expected to yield unbiased results while ﬁndings from
nonrandomized comparisons may over or understate effects. Weisburd et al.
(2001), for example, found larger effects in nonrandomized studies of criminal
justice programs though, for CBT, Pearson et al. (2002) reported larger effects for
studies of higher methodological quality. After assignment to conditions, attrition
from outcome measurement can also bias effect estimates if, as is likely, it is not
randomly distributed across conditions. The operationalization of the outcome
measure is another potential source of difference. Even when the focus is on
recidivism, some studies index it with the rate of rearrest, others by assessing
reconvictions, incarcerations, probation or parole violations, and the like. More-
over, the timing of recidivism measurement varies, ranging from a period close to
the end of treatment to months or years later.
Purpose of this meta-analysis
The objective of this meta-analysis is to examine the relationships of selected
moderator variables to the effects of CBT on the recidivism of adult and juvenile
offenders. In order to have a sufﬁcient number of studies to permit examination
of between-study differences, an especially thorough search was made of the
available research. To assist in expanding the number of studies, and to ensure

methodological diversity so that variation in methods could be investigated, quasi-
experimental studies were included as well as randomized ﬁeld experiments.
Though not all potentially interesting moderator variables are reported well enough
in the source studies to allow systematic comparison, a detailed coding protocol
was applied to extract as much relevant information for analysis as possible from
each study report.
Methods
Criteria for inclusion of studies
Studies were assessed and selected for this meta-analysis if they met the following
criteria:
Intervention
The treatment under investigation was a variant of cognitiveYbehavioral therapy
representing or substantially similar to such recognized Fbrand name_ CBT
programs as Reasoning and Rehabilitation (Ross and Fabiano 1985), Moral
Reconation Therapy (Little and Robinson 1986), Aggression Replacement
Training (Goldstein and Glick 1987), the Thinking for a Change curriculum (Bush
et al. 1997), and the Cognitive Interventions Program (NIC, 1996). In particular, it
was directed toward changing distorted or dysfunctional cognitions (cognitive
restructuring) or teaching new cognitive skills and involved therapeutic techniques
typically associated with CBT, i.e., structured learning experiences designed to
affect such cognitive processes as interpreting social cues, monitoring one’s own
thought processes, identifying and compensating for distortions and errors in
thinking, reasoning about right and wrong behavior, generating alternative
solutions, and making decisions about appropriate behavior. If CBT was offered
in the context of a multimodal program that simultaneously provided other
services, the CBT must have been provided to all participants and constitute a
major component of the program.
Participants
The recipients of the intervention were criminal offenders, either juveniles or
adults, treated while on probation, incarcerated/institutionalized, or during
aftercare/parole. Offenders were drawn from a general offender population and
not selected for, or restricted to, those committing speciﬁc types of offenses (e.g.,
sex offenses, DUI, drug offenses, status offenses).
Outcome measures
The study reported criminal offending subsequent to treatment as an outcome
variable. Outcome results were presented in a quantitative form that permitted
computation or reasonable estimation of an effect size statistic representing the
difference in recidivism rates between treated and untreated offenders.

Research methods
The study used a randomized or quasi-experimental design that compared a CBT
treatment condition with a control condition that did not include CBT treatment.
Quasi-experimental designs were eligible only if subjects in the treatment and
control conditions were matched or statistically controlled on pre-treatment risk-
related variables (e.g., relevant personal, demographic, and criminal background
characteristics) or if pre-treatment measures of criminal or antisocial behavior or
signiﬁcant risk factors for such behavior were reported in a form that permitted
assessment of the initial equivalence of the treatment and control groups. To
eliminate explicit self-selection as a biasing factor in group assignment, however,
studies were not included if the control groups were created with individuals who
began CBT but dropped out prior to completing treatment or who were offered
CBT and refused. Control groups could represent placebo, wait-list, no treatment,
or Ftreatment as usual_ conditions, with the latter restricted to cases of clearly
routine probation, institutional, or aftercare/parole practices.
Source
Both published and unpublished studies were eligible for inclusion, conducted in
any country, and reported in any language.
Search strategy
An initial set of eligible studies came from those assembled and analyzed for the
Lipsey et al. (2001) and Lipsey and Landenberger (2005) meta-analyses. This
number was expanded through a comprehensive search using the following
procedures.
Meta-analysis databases
The second author has constructed a meta-analysis database of coded studies for
interventions with juvenile offenders based on a comprehensive search for studies
reported in 2002 or earlier. All the studies in that database were reviewed for
eligibility and an independent search was conducted for studies published after
2002. In addition, the studies in a database of interventions with adult offenders
that is nearing completion were reviewed for eligibility.
Database searches
Computerized bibliography searches were conducted for studies reported from
1965 through 2005. To the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst systematic applications
of CBT to offenders were developed and published in the mid-1970s (e.g.,
Yochelson and Samenow 1976); searching back to 1965 was aimed at ensuring that
none were missed. The keywords for searching were concatenations of words
describing the population (e.g., inmates, offenders), CBT treatment (e.g., cognitive,
CBT, criminal thinking), and effectiveness research (e.g., outcomes, evaluation,
effectiveness). The databases searched included the Campbell Collaboration
Social, Psychological, Educational and Criminological Trials Register (C2-

SPECTR), Dissertation Abstracts Online, ERIC, MEDLINE, The National
Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS), PsychInfo/PsychLit, Sociological
Abstracts, and a number of others.
Cross-referencing of bibliographies
Relevant review articles, meta-analyses, and primary studies reviewed for
eligibility were scanned for citations to potentially eligible studies.
Internet searches
Relevant government websites (e.g., NIJ, NIC, OJJDP, Home Ofﬁce) as well as
foundation, professional associations and policy research ﬁrm websites were
searched. In addition, keyword searches were conducted using search engines such
as google.com.
Journals
Vanderbilt University subscribes to a large number of electronic journals and the
full text of those judged relevant was searched with selected keywords. Major
journals publishing empirical studies related to crime and delinquency were also
hand searched for eligible studies.
Informal sources
Unpublished results from evaluations of two CBT programs were available from
the ﬁrst author, and several colleagues alerted us to eligible studies that were not
accessible through the above channels.
The search for CBT studies on adult offenders produced 2,947 study citations
with 771 reports judged promising enough to retrieve for closer examination. The
search for juvenile offender studies produced 1,487 study citations with 299 reports
retrieved. Review of the retrieved studies ultimately identiﬁed 58 studies meeting
the criteria for inclusion in the present meta-analysis.
Data management and extraction
Descriptive and outcome data were coded for each of the 58 eligible studies using
a coding protocol developed speciﬁcally for this purpose. Table 1, presented later,
shows the major coding categories used for descriptive information. Recidivism
outcomes were reported in several different forms but, in virtually all instances,
either the proportions of offenders in each research condition that recidivated were
speciﬁed or information was provided from which the proportions could be esti-
mated. When more than one recidivism outcome was reported, only one was se-
lected for analysis using criteria that maximized cross-study similarity on the
variables and times of measurement. This procedure favored rearrest recidivism,
then reconviction and incarceration in that order, and the measure taken closest to
12 months post-treatment.

EFFECTS OF CBT FOR OFFENDERS

The selected recidivism outcomes were coded as odds ratios representing the
odds of Fsuccess_ (not recidivating) for treatment group participants relative to the
odds for control participants. For binary outcomes, the odds ratio provides an effect
size statistic that has favorable properties and yields readily interpretable results
(Haddock et al. 1998). Statistical analysis with odds ratios is facilitated if they are
represented by their log, so the logged odds ratios were used in all analyses.
Otherwise, the statistical analysis was conducted using conventional meta-analysis
techniques (Lipsey and Wilson 2001) with each effect size weighted by its inverse
variance in random effects analyses.
Results
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the 58 studies included in the meta-
analysis. Several features of this research are notable. Randomized designs,
matched designs, and group comparisons using neither of these procedures are
represented in roughly equal numbers and involve a wide range of sample sizes.
Attrition from outcome measurement is virtually zero in a majority of the studies
but ranges over 30% in some of the remaining ones. About half the programs
studied were implemented as routine practice with the other half set up and
implemented by researchers as either demonstration or research programs, with
demonstration programs deﬁned as those mounted mainly for research purposes
but at a scale and in a manner somewhat more representative of actual practice
than those categorized as research programs. More studies were conducted with
adult than juvenile offenders and most used only or predominately male offenders.
Treatment was administered while the offenders were incarcerated in a correctional
institution in nearly half the studies and generally lasted less than 20 weeks. In
most instances, the treatment providers had little or no evident mental health
background and had received relatively minimal training in cognitive behavioral
therapy. The treatment was typically one of the Fbrand name_ manualized CBT
programs and incorporated multiple treatment elements.
Effect size variation associated with study methods
The mean odds ratio representing the average effect of intervention was 1.53 ( p G
0.001), indicating that the odds of success (no recidivism in the post-intervention
interval of approximately 12 months) for individuals in the treatment group were
more than one and a half times as great as those for individuals in the control
group. In relation to the mean recidivism rate for the control groups of about 0.40,
this odds ratio indicates a recidivism reduction of 25% to 0.30. There was also
signiﬁcant variation across studies in the odds ratio for intervention effects (Q =
214.02, df = 57, p G 0.001). We turn now to an examination of the study
characteristics associated with that variation.
The recidivism effects observed in the studies in this meta-analysis are
potentially inﬂuenced by both the methodological characteristics of the studies
NANA A. LANDENBERGER AND MARK W. LIPSEY
460

and the substantive attributes of the treatments and the recipients. One of the
ﬁrst steps in the analysis, therefore, was to determine which methodological
features were correlated with the effect sizes so they could be controlled
while examining relationships with substantive attributes. The method variables
available from the study coding and considered relevant for this purpose were as
follows:
(a) Design, categorized as randomized, matched, or neither, each dummy coded to
produce three design variables.
(b) Design problemYindications of initial nonequivalence between groups on pre-
treatment variables, or problems during or after the intervention that could
have led to nonequivalence of the treatment and control group, rated by the
coder on a three-point scale (1 = favors control group; 2 = favors neither or
insufﬁcient evidence; 3 = favors treatment group).
(c) Attrition proportion Y the proportion of the total initial sample (treatment plus
control group) for which recidivism outcome data were not available.
(d) Intent to treat, coded yes/no for whether treatment dropouts were retained in
the treatment group for the recidivism outcome data reported in the study.
(e) Type of recidivism, categorized as rearrests, reconvictions, incarcerations, or
other with each dummy coded to produce four recidivism variables.
(f) Recidivism interval represented by the number of months posttreatment over
which recidivism was measured. Because of the possibility of more frequent
recidivism in early months than later ones, the log of this variable was also
used in the analysis.

Table 2 shows the zero-order correlation of each of the method variables with the
recidivism effect sizes (represented as logged odds ratios). These are inverse-
variance weighted, random effects analyses with the random effects component
estimated using maximum likelihood techniques (Raudenbush 1994).
As Table 2 reports, there was no signiﬁcant relationship overall between the
effect sizes and the study design. In particular, the effects observed in randomized
studies did not differ signiﬁcantly from those observed in matched studies or those
with comparison groups that were neither matched nor randomly assigned. Nor
was a signiﬁcant relationship observed for the coder’s rating of whether there was
an evident design problem favoring the control or treatment group, that is,
indications of nonequivalence that might affect recidivism outcomes. Similarly,
there were no signiﬁcant correlations with the attrition proportion, the way
recidivism was measured, or the interval over which it was measured.
The only methodological variable that showed a signiﬁcant ( p G 0.10)
relationship with the effect size was whether the study presented the treat-
mentYcontrol contrast as an intent-to-treat analysis. When the treatment dropouts
were included in the outcome recidivism, the effect sizes were smaller than when
they were excluded, as would be expected. In light of this indication that the intent-
to-treat variable might inﬂuence effect sizes, it was carried forward as a control
variable for the analysis of the relationships between effect sizes and substantive
factors relating to the treatment and recipients. As a further precaution against
confounds with methodological characteristics, the other three method variables
with zero-order correlations of 0.10 or greater were also included as method
controls (design problem, attrition proportion, and rearrest recidivism).
Effect size variation associated with the treatment and its recipients
The relationship between the recidivism effect sizes and each of the descriptive
variables for CBT treatment and its recipients (see listing in Table 1) was next
examined with the four selected method variables included as controls. These
analyses were conducted with a set of random effects multiple regressions that
included a descriptive variable and the four control variables. These were run
separately for each descriptive variable in this initial analysis to ensure that any
having potentially important relationships with effect size were identiﬁed despite
whatever correlations they had with other variables in the set. Because of the
modest number of studies and the broad conﬁdence intervals associated with
random effects analysis, alpha = 0.10 was set as the threshold for statistical signi-
ﬁcance. Table 3 presents the results.
The variables in Table 3 are grouped into categories that represent different
aspects of the studies and the nature of the CBT treatment studied. The most
general study characteristics (country, type of publication, and date of publication)
showed no signiﬁcant relationships with effect size. The other candidate moderator
variables are grouped according to a simple model that assumes that, with method
variables controlled, treatment effects will be a function of the characteristics of

the participants, the amount of treatment received, the quality of the treatment
implementation, and the speciﬁc type of treatment.
Participant characteristics
Of the characteristics of the treatment recipients that could be coded from most
studies, only the recidivism risk rating was signiﬁcantly related to the effect sizes.
This rating was made by the coder on the basis of the description in the study of
the criminal history of the treated offenders and the recidivism rate of the control
group. That rating, in turn, was not signiﬁcantly correlated with any of the other
variables describing the participants shown in Table 3. It is worth noting that there
was no relationship between effect size and whether the treated offenders were
juveniles or adults. The gender mix of the CBT recipients also showed no
relationship to effect size but, as Table 1 shows, most of the samples were all male
or predominately male so there was little variation on this measure.
Amount of CBT
Dosage variables were coded as the number of sessions per week, the number of
hours of treatment per week, the total hours of treatment, and the number of weeks
of treatment from beginning to end (see Table 1). The distributions for the latter
three had long tails and the logged values of these variables were used in the
analysis (and showed stronger relationships to effect size than the unlogged
versions). As Table 3 shows, all these variables except length of treatment were
signiﬁcantly related to effect size. Total hours, which showed the largest
relationship, however, is a function of both the number of hours per week and
the number of weeks. The study-level correlations among these variables showed
that length of treatment was signiﬁcantly related to total hours (r = 0.51) as were
the number of sessions per week (r = 0.58) and number of hours per week (r =
0.75), with the latter two being highly correlated with each other (r = 0.81).
From this pattern of relationships we concluded that the best representation of
the amount of treatment should distinguish the number of sessions or hours per
week from the length of the treatment. That approach allows further examination
of the ﬁnding in Table 3 that number of sessions and hours per week are related to
the effect size but, apparently, the duration of treatment is not. Between the
number of sessions per week and the number of hours, sessions showed the

stronger relationship to effect size. Table 3 also shows the interaction between
number of sessions and length of treatment, but it was not signiﬁcantly related to
effect size.
Quality of CBT implementation
In this category we include the practice-research dimension that distinguishes
between CBT treatments implemented on a routine basis in real-world criminal
justice contexts, demonstration programs in similar circumstances but with
signiﬁcant inﬂuence by the researcher, and research programs implemented by
the researchers largely for research purposes. Our assumption is that the
progressively greater involvement of researchers translates into better implemen-
tation and more ﬁdelity to the treatment protocol.
Table 4 shows that the study-level correlations were all signiﬁcant between the
practice-research variable and the other variables assumed related to implemen-
tation quality listed in Table 3 Y proportion of dropouts from treatment, extent of
implementation monitoring reported, amount of CBT training indicated for
providers, and the mental health background of the providers. Table 3 shows
relationships in the expected direction with effect size for all these variables
except providers’ mental health background, though only proportion of treat-
ment dropouts and the practice-research dimension reached statistical signiﬁcance.
To summarize the relationship of these implementation quality variables to effect
size, a composite variable was created in the form of a factor score from a principal
components analysis. As shown in Table 3, that composite implementation factor is
more strongly related to the effect sizes than any of the component variables.
Other program characteristics
Table 3 also shows the relationship between effect size and two other program
characteristics. One is the setting within which CBT was provided, differentiated

between treatment while incarcerated and treatment in the community (e.g., for
probationers and parolees); this variable was not signiﬁcantly related to effect size.
The extent to which CBT was emphasized in the treatment program, on the other
hand, did show a signiﬁcant relationship. That variable ranged across categories of
CBT supplemented by other services, CBT with some other treatment elements, and
CBT alone. As the negative sign on the coefﬁcient in Table 3 shows, the effects are
signiﬁcantly larger when CBT is combined with other services. Examples of such
components include mental health counseling, employment and vocational training,
and educational programs.
Speciﬁc nature of the CBT treatment
The last two sections of Table 3 show two alternative ways of representing the
speciﬁc nature of the CBT treatment provided. One set of dummy-coded items
differentiates the various major named types of CBT along with a somewhat more
generic category of CBT programs focusing on substance abuse and two residual
categories of less common but manualized treatments and a few that do not appear
to be manualized. None of these program variables is signiﬁcantly related to effect
size, meaning that no brand of CBT produces effects that stand out from the
average of the other brands.
The other way we coded CBT treatment was in terms of the speciﬁc treatment
elements identiﬁed in the descriptions provided in the study reports. Those de-
scriptions varied in detail and extensiveness but when they mentioned a distinct
treatment element, we coded it as present using a dummy code. The elements that
appeared with sufﬁcient frequency to support analysis are shown in Table 3, de-
ﬁned brieﬂy as follows:
 Cognitive skills: Training on general thinking and decision-making skills such
as to stop and think before acting, generate alternative solutions, evaluate
consequences, and make decisions about appropriate behavior.
 Cognitive restructuring: Activities and exercises aimed at recognizing and
modifying the distortions and errors that characterize criminogenic thinking.
 Interpersonal problem solving: Training in problem-solving skills for dealing
with interpersonal conﬂict and peer pressure.
 Social skills: Training in prosocial behaviors, interpreting social cues, taking
other persons’ feelings into account, and the like.
 Anger control: Training in techniques for identifying triggers and cues that
arouse anger and maintaining self-control.
 Moral reasoning: Activities designed to improve the ability to reason about right
and wrong behavior and raise the level of moral development.
 Victim impact: Activities aimed and getting offenders to consider the impact of
their behavior on their victims.
 Substance abuse: Application of any of the typical CBT techniques speciﬁcally
to the issue of substance abuse.
 Behavior modiﬁcation: Behavioral contracts and/or reward and penalty schemes
designed to reinforce appropriate behavior.
NANA A. LANDENBERGER AND MARK W. LIPSEY

 Relapse prevention: Training on strategies to recognize and cope with high-risk
situations and halt the relapse cycle before lapses turn into full relapses.
 Individual attention: Any individualized one-on-one treatment element that
supplements CBT group sessions, e.g., individual counseling.
As Table 3 shows, the presence of some of these treatment elements in the CBT
program was signiﬁcantly related to effect sizes. The strongest relationship appeared
for individual attention, followed by anger control and cognitive restructuring.
The relative inﬂuence of different moderator variables
The results presented in Table 3 identify a number of variables describing the
participants and the CBT interventions that are related to treatment effects with key

differentiate the circumstances of CBT treatment that yield larger and smaller
effects on recidivism. The variable-by-variable results in Table 3, however, do not
tell us about the relative inﬂuence of the different moderators. To examine the
independent relationships of these variables with the others taken into account, two
summary random effects regression analyses were conducted. These were con-
ﬁgured to model the treatment effect sizes as a function of participant character-
istics, the amount of CBT, the quality of the CBT, and the speciﬁc type of CBT,
with method differences controlled.
Drawing on the results in Table 3, the relevant participant characteristics were
represented by recidivism risk, the only variable in that set signiﬁcantly related to
effect size. The amount of CBT was represented by the combination of variables

previously designated for that purpose Y sessions per week, length in weeks, and
their interaction. The quality of the CBT implementation was represented by the
composite implementation factor, also described earlier. The type of CBT was
represented in the ﬁrst analysis as the set of brand name categories (with the two
Fother_ categories omitted as a reference set). In the second it was represented in
terms of the speciﬁc treatment elements identiﬁed as present in the intervention. In
both analyses, the CBT emphasis variable was also included to add information
about the primacy of CBT in the overall intervention.
Table 5 shows the results when the CBT was represented in brand name
categories. Once again, no speciﬁc type of CBT program had effects signiﬁcantly
different from the mean of all the other types. Only two moderator variables
were individually signiﬁcant in this analysis Y recidivism risk (higher risk was
associated with larger effects) and the composite implementation factor (higher
quality implementation was associated with larger effects).
Table 6 shows the parallel analysis with the CBT intervention represented in
terms of treatment elements. As in the previous analysis, recidivism risk and high
quality implementation were associated with better outcomes. In addition, how-
ever, four of the individual treatment elements showed signiﬁcant relationships
with effect size. Interpersonal problem solving and anger control were positively
related; their presence was associated with larger effects on recidivism. Victim
impact and behavior modiﬁcation were negatively related; they were associated
with worse outcomes.
Effects of FBest practice_ CBT on recidivism
We can use the multiple regression analysis in Table 6 to explore optimal CBT
treatment circumstances by predicting the effect size expected in a favorable
scenario. For this purpose we assumed the best quality study method and
measurement characteristics (no design problems, zero attrition, intent-to-treat
analysis, and an arrest recidivism outcome). We also assumed the subject sample
was comprised of moderately high risk offenders who received the median number
of sessions per week (two) with high quality implementation over the median
number of weeks (16). The CBT treatment assumed was any one of the brand
name programs alone (not supplemented with other services), but with anger
control and interpersonal problem-solving components included.
When the corresponding variable values are entered into the prediction equation
represented in Table 6, the predicted effect size is a logged odds ratio of 1.05,
corresponding to an odds ratio of 2.86. Compared to a control group recidivism
of 0.40 (the overall mean), this represents a decrease to a recidivism rate of 0.19
in the treatment group, that is, a 52% decrease overall. This impressive effect is
not a mathematical projection beyond what appears in the data. An odds ratio of
2.86 is at the 82nd percentile of the distribution of effects for the 58 studies in this
meta-analysis.

Discussion
This meta-analysis conﬁrmed the ﬁndings of positive CBT effects on the re-
cidivism of offenders that have been reported in other recent meta-analyses (Lipsey
et al. 2001; Lipsey and Landenberger (2005); Pearson et al. 2002; Wilson et al.
2005). The mean odds ratio indicated that the odds of not recidivating in the 12
months after intervention for individuals in the treatment group were 1.53 times as
great as those for individuals in the control group. This represents a reduction from
the 0.40 mean recidivism rate of the control groups to a mean rate of 0.30 for the
treatment groups, a 25% decrease. The most effective conﬁgurations of CBT
produced odds ratios nearly twice as large as the mean, corresponding to re-
cidivism rates of around 0.19 in the treatment groups, more than a 50% decrease
from the 0.40 rate of the average control group.
The main emphasis of this meta-analysis, however, was the search for key
moderator variables that would distinguish situations in which CBT produced
larger effects from those in which it produced smaller ones. On this issue, there
are two themes in the ﬁndings. First, a number of variables characterizing the sub-
ject samples, amount and implementation of CBT, and the CBT treatment elements
were signiﬁcantly correlated with the effect sizes for recidivism outcomes. In this
regard, there are numerous moderators of the treatment effects. These are not all
independent relationships, however. Intervention studies tend to come with bundles
of co-occurring characteristics that are, therefore, correlated with each other across
studies. This confounding of moderator variables with each other makes it difﬁcult
to identify those most critical to the outcome (Lipsey 2003).
Application of multiple regression analysis to identify the moderator variables
with the strongest independent relationships to effect size led to the second theme
in our ﬁndings. Of the many study characteristics that showed signiﬁcant
relationships with effect size, relatively few remained signiﬁcant when the
inﬂuence of the others was taken into account. The net result was that much of
the variation in recidivism effects could be explained by a small number of
moderator variables. The only factors independently related to the effect sizes were
(a) the risk level of the participating offenders, (b) how well the treatment was
implemented, and (c) the presence or absence of a few treatment elements. In the
latter category, inclusion of anger control and interpersonal problem solving
components in the treatment program were associated with larger effects; inclusion
of victim impact and behavior modiﬁcation were associated with smaller effects.
Most striking was that, controlled for other moderators, none of the major CBT
brand name programs produced effects on recidivism that were signiﬁcantly larger
than the average effects of the other programs.
Though not informative for purposes of identifying the most effective treat-
ment conditions, the relationships between characteristics of the study methods
and the effects sizes were nonetheless interesting. The aspect of method that is
usually of greatest concern for intervention studies is whether a randomized design
was used. For the studies included in this meta-analysis, however, there were no
signiﬁcant effect size differences between randomized and nonrandomized de-
NANA A. LANDENBERGER AND MARK W. LIPSEY
470

signs. Only the intent-to-treat variable, indicating whether treatment dropouts
were included in the outcome measures, was signiﬁcantly related to effect size and
that relationship dissipated when other moderators were included in the analysis.
Implications for practice
With the key participant and general implementation characteristics controlled, no
signiﬁcant differences were found in the effectiveness of the different types or
Fbrand names_ of CBT. It thus appears to be the general CBT approach, and not
any speciﬁc version, that is responsible for the overall positive effects on recid-
ivism. Within that framework, inclusion of distinct anger control and interper-
sonal problem solving components in the CBT program enhance the effects while
victim impact and behavior modiﬁcation components appear to diminish it.
What seems to most strongly characterize effective CBT programs is high qual-
ity implementation as represented by low proportions of treatment dropouts, close
monitoring of the quality and ﬁdelity of the treatment implementation, and ade-
quate CBT training for the providers. These characteristics are more closely asso-
ciated with research and demonstration programs than with those implemented in
routine practice. This is an encouraging picture from the standpoint of practice. It
suggests that any representative CBT program that is well-implemented might have
results in practice that approach the very positive effects on recidivism produced
by the most effective programs documented in the available research studies.
It is also encouraging that the effects of CBT were greater for offenders with
higher risk of recidivism than those with lower risk, contrary to any presumption
that higher risk offenders might be less amenable to treatment. The effectiveness of
CBT with higher risk offenders is consistent with the principles of effective
correctional treatment developed by Andrews et al. (e.g., Andrews and Bonta
2002; Andrews et al. 1990). They argue that the best results occur when higher-risk
offenders receive more intensive services that target criminogenic needs (e.g.,
criminal thinking patterns) using cognitive behavioral and social learning
approaches.
From a practical standpoint, it is also worth highlighting a couple of variables
that were not related to treatment effects once other relevant program character-
istics were controlled. In particular, CBT was as effective for juveniles as adults,
other things equal, and thus should be useful in both juvenile justice and criminal
justice settings. The treatment setting was also not related to treatment effects.
Offenders treated in prison (generally close to the end of their sentences) showed
recidivism decreases comparable to those of offenders treated in the community
(e.g., while on probation, parole or in transitional aftercare).
Implications for research
Of the 58 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review, only 19 used random
assignment designs and, of those, only 13 maintained sufﬁciently low attrition from
outcome measurement to yield results with high internal validity. Moreover, only

six of the random assignment studies were conducted on Freal world_ CBT practice;
the others were research and demonstration programs. The amount of high quality
research on CBT in representative correctional practice is not yet large enough to
determine whether the impressive effects on recidivism found in this meta-analysis
can be routinely attained under everyday circumstances.
Though generalization to routine practice cannot be assured, the consistency
and magnitude of the effects found in the research to date leave little doubt that
CBT is capable of producing signiﬁcant reductions in the recidivism of even high
risk offenders under favorable conditions. However, much remains to be learned
about the optimal conﬁguration of CBT and the conditions under which it is most
effective. In this meta-analysis we coded as much detail as possible about the
program characteristics and context from the descriptions provided in the research
reports. At best, those descriptions were limited and fell well short of providing
full information about critical program details. An important direction for future
research is to better differentiate and document the dimensions along which CBT
varies in different applications and to identify the characteristics most critical for
attaining optimal effects. The central issue for research on CBT with offender
populations at this juncture is not to determine if it has positive effects, but to
determine when and why it has the most positive effects.
