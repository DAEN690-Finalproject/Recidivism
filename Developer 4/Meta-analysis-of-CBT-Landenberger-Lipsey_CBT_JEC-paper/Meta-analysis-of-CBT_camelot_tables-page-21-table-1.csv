"signs. Only
the
intent-to-treat
variable,
indicating whether
treatment
dropouts"
"were included in the outcome measures, was signiﬁcantly related to effect size and"
"that relationship dissipated when other moderators were included in the analysis."
"Implications for practice"
"With the key participant and general
implementation characteristics controlled, no"
"signiﬁcant differences were
found in the
effectiveness of
the different
types or"
"It
thus appears to be the general CBT approach, and not
Fbrand names_ of CBT."
"any speciﬁc version,
that
is
responsible for
the overall positive effects on recid-"
"ivism. Within that
framework,
inclusion of distinct
anger
control
and interper-"
"sonal problem solving components in the CBT program enhance the effects while"
"victim impact and behavior modiﬁcation components appear to diminish it."
"What seems to most strongly characterize effective CBT programs is high qual-"
"ity implementation as represented by low proportions of treatment dropouts, close"
"monitoring of
the quality and ﬁdelity of
the treatment
implementation, and ade-"
"quate CBT training for the providers. These characteristics are more closely asso-"
"ciated with research and demonstration programs than with those implemented in"
"routine practice. This is an encouraging picture from the standpoint of practice. It"
"suggests that any representative CBT program that is well-implemented might
have"
"results in practice that approach the very positive effects on recidivism produced"
"by the most effective programs documented in the available research studies."
"It
is also encouraging that
the effects of CBT were greater
for offenders with"
"higher
risk of
recidivism than those with lower
risk, contrary to any presumption"
"that higher risk offenders might be less amenable to treatment. The effectiveness of"
"CBT with
higher
risk
offenders
is
consistent with
the
principles
of
effective"
"correctional
treatment
developed
by Andrews
et
al.
(e.g., Andrews
and Bonta"
"2002; Andrews et al. 1990). They argue that the best results occur when higher-risk"
"offenders
receive more
intensive
services
that
target
criminogenic
needs
(e.g.,"
"criminal
thinking
patterns)
using
cognitive
behavioral
and
social
learning"
"approaches."
"From a practical standpoint,
it
is also worth highlighting a couple of variables"
"that were not
related to treatment effects once other
relevant program character-"
"istics were controlled.
In particular, CBT was as effective for
juveniles as adults,"
"other things equal, and thus should be useful
in both juvenile justice and criminal"
"justice
settings. The
treatment
setting was
also not
related to treatment effects."
"Offenders treated in prison (generally close to the end of
their sentences) showed"
"recidivism decreases comparable to those of offenders
treated in the community"
"(e.g., while on probation, parole or
in transitional aftercare)."
"Implications for research"
"Of the 58 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review, only 19 used random"
"assignment designs and, of those, only 13 maintained sufﬁciently low attrition from"
"outcome measurement
to yield results with high internal validity. Moreover, only"
