"methodological diversity so that variation in methods could be investigated, quasi-"
"experimental
studies were
included
as well
as
randomized
ﬁeld
experiments."
"Though not all potentially interesting moderator variables are reported well enough"
"in the source studies
to allow systematic comparison, a detailed coding protocol"
"was applied to extract as much relevant
information for analysis as possible from"
"each study report."
"Methods"
"Criteria for inclusion of studies"
"Studies were assessed and selected for this meta-analysis if they met
the following"
"criteria:"
"Intervention"
"The treatment under
investigation was a variant of cognitiveYbehavioral
therapy"
"representing
or
substantially
similar
to
such
recognized
Fbrand
name_ CBT"
"programs
as Reasoning
and Rehabilitation
(Ross
and
Fabiano
1985), Moral"
"Reconation
Therapy
(Little
and Robinson
1986), Aggression Replacement"
"Training (Goldstein and Glick 1987),
the Thinking for a Change curriculum (Bush"
"et al. 1997), and the Cognitive Interventions Program (NIC, 1996). In particular,
it"
"was
directed
toward
changing
distorted
or
dysfunctional
cognitions
(cognitive"
"restructuring) or teaching new cognitive skills and involved therapeutic techniques"
"typically associated with CBT,
i.e.,
structured learning experiences designed to"
"affect such cognitive processes as interpreting social cues, monitoring one’s own"
"thought
processes,
identifying
and
compensating
for
distortions
and
errors
in"
"thinking,
reasoning
about
right
and wrong
behavior,
generating
alternative"
"solutions, and making decisions about appropriate behavior.
If CBT was offered"
"in
the
context
of
a multimodal
program that
simultaneously
provided
other"
"services,
the CBT must have been provided to all participants
and constitute a"
"major component of the program."
"Participants"
"The
recipients
of
the
intervention were
criminal
offenders,
either
juveniles
or"
"adults,
treated while
on
probation,
incarcerated/institutionalized,
or
during"
"aftercare/parole. Offenders were drawn from a general offender population and"
"not selected for, or restricted to,
those committing speciﬁc types of offenses (e.g.,"
"sex offenses, DUI, drug offenses, status offenses)."
"Outcome measures"
"The
study reported
criminal offending subsequent
to treatment
as
an outcome"
"variable. Outcome
results were presented in a quantitative
form that permitted"
"computation or
reasonable estimation of an effect
size statistic representing the"
"difference in recidivism rates between treated and untreated offenders."
