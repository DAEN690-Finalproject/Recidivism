"To create our study database, we first examined all published meta-analyses and systematic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reviews of prison-based CBT programs for mental and behavioral disorders published during our,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
review period (2000-present). Fourteen meta-analyses and systematic reviews were identified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

evaluations of prison-based CBT programs operating in the 1990’s and earlier are not relevant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"today, because of changes over time in program design components and incarcerated",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"populations. In fact, many of the programs addressed in this chapter were developed in the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2000’s and later. Our review of these meta-analyses and systematic reviews did reveal several,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
studies conducted since 2000; we included these studies in our review.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The next step in our study identification process was to determine whether these meta-analyses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and systematic reviews perhaps missed relevant evaluations due to the search procedures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
employed; or excluded them from their review due to their study inclusion criteria. To address,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this issue, we conducted a systematic search of the following electronic databases:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We used the following specific terms for our systematic search of electronic databases:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cognitive behavioral therapy AND prison or jail or incarceration or imprisonment or correction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
facilities NOT youths or young people or adolescents or teenagers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition, we decided to conduct a separate search, in the same series of databases, for anger",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
management program evaluations. The following search terms were used in this second search:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anger management AND prison or jail or incarceration or imprisonment or correction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
facilities NOT youths or young people or adolescents or teenagers AND recidivism or,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reoffending or repeat offender.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This search initially yielded 335 hits, with a list of 17 studies once duplicates were removed from",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the database. Visual inspection of the titles and abstracts by the research team further reduced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the number of potential studies to 7 titles meeting our initial review criteria and requiring in-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depth review. In addition, one meta-analysis of 96 anger management programs utilizing 9",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"distinct program models (Saini, 2009) was also identified at this stage and reviewed (see",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“After 2 1/2 years of treatment, patients also were
less likely to react with anxiety, fear, anger, or
aggression in stressful situations. These changes
could also be related to treatment in which patients
are encouraged to be open about their feelings and
are taught alternative behaviors to cope with
unpleasant feelings and stressful situations. Patients
reported significantly fewer avoiding coping
strategies and more social support seeking coping
strategies than at baseline. With respect to
assertiveness, patients reported less anxiety in
interpersonal assertive behaviors, though they were
not acting assertively more frequently.” (602)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
