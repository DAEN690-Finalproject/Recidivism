group of non-completers.
Sample: “After constructing a
matched dataset through
PSM, the final sample size of
this study became 680
including 340 offenders who
earned a one-year college
certificate or higher degree
while incarcerated and their
matching counterparts.”
(198)","offenders who did not have a
high-school diploma (HSD) or a
High School Equivalency (HSE)
status at admission and did not
earn such a diploma while
incarcerated because they are
academic pre-requisites for
admission into the prison-based
college education program.
Lastly, those who held a valid
one-year college certificate or
higher college degree at
admission are excluded because
the purpose of this study is to
understand how prison-based
college education attainment can
help prisoners maintain a law-
abiding life once released.” (198)","degree in prison decreases the risk of recidivism

of 2 years in prison; and

but differences in the sample
used to test misconduct and
recidivism effects make a
summary of study findings
difficult, and limitations in the
data available for PSM.
Note: Apprenticeship programs
and vocational programs were
combined in a single group,
which may have masked the
effects of one of these program
types.","Reported findings: “Inmates who earned GEDs or
completed college classes were less likely than
nonprogram inmates to engage in violence
during incarceration, whereas completing
vocational training and apprenticeship programs
had no such effect on any type of inmate
misconduct examined. On the other hand,
completing vocational training and
apprenticeship programs, GEDs, or college
classes at any point during incarceration
coincided with lower rates of prison returns
within 3 years after release. None of these
benefits accrued to inmates who started but did
not complete these programs/classes.” (515)"
