propensity score matching (PSM)
techniques, but evidence of non-
equivalent groups identified by
researchers. The researchers
noted the lack of program
(fidelity) data as a limitation.
They offered the following: “It is
likely that important variations
exist between institutions in
terms of program structure,
organization, and other
potentially important factors that
may affect the strength of the
relationship between PSE and
recidivism.”","The authors concluded that “the results of the
quantitative study provide mixed results in terms
of PSE’s impact on post-release recidivism. In two
states, PSE was associated with a decrease in
recidivism, while in a third it was associated with
an increase. However, only one of these effects—
a decrease in recidivism—was statistically
significant.” (13) Researchers note the following:
“The reduction in recidivism risk attributable to
PSE for Indiana (-3.40%) and Massachusetts (-
14.19%) were similar to those shown in the
simple group comparison (Indiana: -2.85%;
Massachusetts: -13.9%). The impact of PSE on
recidivism for the New Mexico sample was much
stronger (-24.61%) than the difference between
the PSE and non-PSE groups (New Mexico: -
5.54%). The difference in results suggests that
key differences in recidivism risk (excepting PSE
or non-PSE status) remained despite attempts to
balance the groups."
