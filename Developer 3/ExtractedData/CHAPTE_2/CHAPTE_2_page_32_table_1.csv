The researchers also noted: “PoP did not have a
significant effect on recidivism, but several of the
other variables included in the analyses did.
Being male, a racial or ethnic minority, having
more prior supervision failures and felony
convictions, a higher LSI-R score, and being
committed from the Minneapolis/St. Paul
metropolitan area were all significantly
associated with a positive increase in the hazard
for all or most of the four recidivism outcomes.”
