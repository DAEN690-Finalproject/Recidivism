programs
(Arkansas)","Retrospective quasi-
experimental study. Cohort
of individuals released from
Arkansas prison between
2005 and 2013 (n=32,174)
who entered prison without a
GED or high school diploma
were included in the
recidivism analyses; a
different cohort was used for
the post-release employment
analyses (2008-2016;
n=40,667). Within both data
sets, individuals who
completed either a GED or a
vocational training program
were compared on these two
outcomes with individuals
who did not complete these
programs.","3 – Adequate research design
with identified nonequivalent
comparison group differences
examined as moderators. Two
demographic variables were
identified as significant
moderators: age and race (see
p.24-25). In addition, individuals
who participated in GED and Voc.
Ed. Programs were included in
the comparison group along with
nonparticipants. Researchers
also examined the impact of
multiple program completion.","Completion of GED or Vocational programs was
found to significantly reduce recidivism
(reincarceration) risk: “Among inmates without
high school diplomas and GEDs at intake, those
completing GED programs had a 4% lower three-
year recidivism rate than those not completing,
and those completing VOC programs had a 10%
lower three-year recidivism rate than those not
completing” (34). Significant improvement in
employment post-release was found for GED
completers, but vocational program completers
did not show these gains. However, these overall
findings changed when age and race were
included as moderators. Both sentencing
variables and participation/completion of other
prison programs moderated the effects of GED
and Voc. Ed. Programs with a significant effect on
recidivism and employment outcomes included
anger management: “Completers of both GED
and anger management programs had a 33.3%
lower relative probability of recidivating within
six months, a30.8% lower relative probability of
recidivating within a year, and a 22.7% lower
relative probability of recidivating within three
years” (32). Substance abuse education:
“completers of both GED and substance abuse
education programs had a 35.0% lower relative
probability of recidivating within six months, a
31.9% lower relative probability of recidivating
within a year, and a 24.1% lower relative
probability of recidivating within three years”"
