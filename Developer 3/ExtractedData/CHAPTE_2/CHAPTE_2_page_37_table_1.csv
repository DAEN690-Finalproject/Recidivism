1999-2000 release cohort
used; compared recidivism
outcomes of 250 GED
program completers with a
matched comparison group
of 153 non-GED participants.","3 – Well-designed study with
groups matched by
demographics and criminal
history. However, the authors
do not provide details on the
types of crimes included in the
“any re-arrest” recidivism
measure, or why different
follow-up periods were used. In
addition, no details were
provided on the decision to
ignore the subgroups of GED
program participants who failed
the GED exam, including how
many times a participant can
take the exam while in the GED
program.","“Sixty-four percent of non-GED participants
recidivated once released, compared with 51% of
GED participants” (381). They also note that
“leaving prison with at least the equivalent of a
high school diploma significantly improves the
chances that one will not recidivate, even after
considering the other risk predictors in offender
research. Other factors that help to mitigate
recidivism rates include race (e.g., white), serving
a shorter sentence, age at arrest (e.g., older as
opposed to younger), violent offense charges,
and being married at the time of one’s arrest.”
