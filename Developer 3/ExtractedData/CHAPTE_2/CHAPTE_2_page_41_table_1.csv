cohorts used to examine
educational achievement while
in prison, employment post-
release, and recidivism.","Researchers found that “Inmates with the highest
education are more likely upon release to obtain
employment, earn higher wages and have lower
recidivism. Educational achievement in prison
was associated with an 11% decrease in the two-
year recidivism rate of inmates (16% recidivism
rate for achievers compared to 1 8% for those
who did not achieve).” (109)"
