(Arizona: Red Rock
Correctional Center

custody private
prison operated by
CoreCivic)",,,"RCT design randomly
assigned 70 incarcerated
individuals to treatment and
control groups: there were 2
treatment groups: 1 ABE class
with tutor(n=15), and 1 GED
class with tutor(n=20); and 2
control groups (1 control
group of ABE [n=15] and 1
control group of GED [n=20]).
Note: “A total of six tutors
were involved, and through a
process of a rotation process
based on subject expertise,
the treatment classes were
provided five trained tutors
to assist the instructor, which
served as the intervention.
All tutors completed a 27-
hour tutor training program
developed locally by the
education staff and focused
on instructional skills and
communication.” (24)","4 – RCT research design used for
a small, 90-day pilot study. Small
sample size is a limitation, but
qualitative interviews with
participants in both groups
provided insights to support the
pilot test quantitative results
presented.","The study was conducted in one medium security
prison and presented preliminary evidence that
tutors in the classroom provide more support for
learning than computer-based support.
According to the author: “This study found that a
group of ABE students who had exposure to the
use of trained peer tutors for up to 90 days
performed better on a post-skills exam (TABE)
than those ABE students who did not have tutors
assigned to assist in their learning process. The
difference in the mean score values between
these groups on the TABE was statistically
significant (p = .03). This difference was not
found with the GED control and treatment
groups. The distinct difference between the ABE
and GED classes, besides their academic
functioning levels, was that the students in both
the control and treatment GED classes all had
access to a computerized learning program that
was set to each student’s skill level.” (30)",,
