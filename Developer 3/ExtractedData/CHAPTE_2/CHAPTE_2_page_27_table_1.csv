(2 studies
2000 and
later)",,,Level 3 or higher,,,"14 studies:
7 Basic Adult
Education (BAE)",,,"BAE: 5.1% RIR (reduction in recidivism)

53 comparisons:
14 Adult Basic
Education and GED
13 post-secondary
education
5 multi-component
programs",,,"Initial positive results for each program type are likely
due to noncomparability of treatment and control
groups. Overall effects difficult to identify due to poor
quality of the research (only 6 studies level 3 and
above).",,
