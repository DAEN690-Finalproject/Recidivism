therapeutic intervention

symptoms of post-
traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD),
depression, anxiety, and
low expectancy of

efficacy)” (40).

control condition and a 3-
month follow-up. One
hundred and twenty-
three people met the
criteria for inclusion in
the study and were
randomly assigned either
to a treatment or a
control condition. In the
experimental condition,
56 individuals were
pretested, received TIR,

week after treatment. In
the control condition, the
remaining 67 individuals
were pretested and post-
tested but did not receive
TIR treatment during the
study period.” (44)","“exclusion criteria

situations that would
be counterproductive

measurement periods except for the Intrusion subscale of
the PTSD Symptom Scale at the posttest interval. However,
differences were found at the follow-up testing interval. It
appears that the control group’s scores remained stable
across all three testing periods, whereas the treatment
condition’s scores decreased steadily.” (49)
“The treatment condition inmates scored higher on the
pretest than did the control condition inmates. The
treatment condition inmates’ decrease continued over
time, and the control condition’s mild decrease stabilized.”
