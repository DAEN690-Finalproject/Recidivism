participants and 15

recruited between 2004-
2005. “Of the 36
participants who were
recruited, 7 in the
intervention group and
11 in the comparison
group completed the

administration of the

administration.","“Participants in the groups described positive outcomes in
the interviews and in the quantitative measurements of
anxiety, depression, and self-esteem. Trends in the data,
however, indicated an additional differential effect related
to program involvement for depression and anxiety scores.
The spirituality scores were high at all times for both
groups, with slight increases over the period of the study.”
(46)
“Results indicated decreased anxiety and depression
scores over time, F(1.59, 25.42) = 8.99, p = .00; F(2, 32) =
15.19, p = .00; respectively, for both the intervention and
comparison groups. There were also trends indicating an
interaction between time and group for both anxiety and
depression, F(1.59, 25.42) = 2.97, p =.08; F(2, 32) = 2.57, p
= .09; respectively, which suggests that those women who
participated in the intervention program had lower
depression scores than did those in the comparison groups
over time.” (56)
“In examining the self-esteem scores over time (see Figure
2), results indicated there were significant increases in
self-esteem scores for both groups, F(2, 32) = 4.42, p = .02.
However, when examining the program impact on self-
esteem (e.g., time and group interactions), no statistically
significant difference was found, F(2, 32) = 1.64, p = .21.
This similar pattern of results was also found with spiritual
well-being, whereby there was no significant change in
spiritual well-being scores over time, F(1.41, 22.53) = 1.85,
p = .19, or interaction between time and group, F(1.41,
22.53) = 0.01, p = .99, indicating a similar rate of change
for both the intervention and control groups over the
three time points.” (56)"
