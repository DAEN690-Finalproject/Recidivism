program description: “SS
was conducted in group
modality for 90 min,
typically three times a
week for 6 to 8 weeks
while the women were in
prison, with three to five
women per group. After
release from prison, each
woman in SS was offered
weekly individual 60-min
“booster” sessions for 12
weeks to reinforce
material from the group
sessions.” (328)","4 - RCT with
limitations, such as
small sample size and
lack of post-program
data. Researchers
noted the following:
“Study limitations
include lack of
assessment of SS
outcomes at end of
group treatment; lack
of blind assessment;
omission of the SS
case management
component; and
possible
contamination
between the two
conditions.” (325)","No difference between groups. Researchers noted: “The
consistent pattern was that women in both SS and TAU
improved significantly from intake to each subsequent
time point (12 weeks, 3- and 6-month follow-ups) on each
category of measurement (e.g., PTSD, substance use,
psychopathology).” (331)
“Six months after release from prison, 53% of the women
in both conditions reported a remission in PTSD.” (325)"
