## WOMEN'S PROGRAMS

In  this  chapter,  we  review  a  series  of  additional  prison-based women's programs. Unlike the women's  programs  reviewed  in  other  chapters  of  this  report,  these  programs  are  offered exclusively to women, with no comparable programs offered to men in the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). In  general,  these  programs  focus  on  two  intertwined components of women's pathways to prison - self-esteem and interpersonal relationships. The BOP offers nine such First Step  Act  (FSA)  approved  programs -three  programs  classified  as  Evidence-Based  Recidivism Reduction (EBRR) Programs, and six programs classified as Productive Activity (PA) Programs. We begin  by  describing  these  BOP  programs  for  women,  briefly  noting  the  application  of  needs assessment procedures addressed in other chapters of this report. We then describe out study identification procedures, provide a review of evaluations conducted both inside and outside of the  BOP,  compare  BOP  programs  to  evaluated  programs  in  other  jurisdictions,  and  offer  an assessment of the effectiveness of each BOP women's program based on our review. For readers with a broader interest in women's programs , we also provide a synopsis of our findings related to  the women's programs addressed in other chapters of this report. W e  then  conclude  this chapter with recommendations for future women's programming initiatives.

## 13.1 Overview of Women's Needs and Women's Programs

As noted above, the BOP offers a series of gender-responsive women's programs. The programs in this chapter of our report are uniquely focused on women's issues and do not fall clearly into the other programming categories. These programs include a residential treatment program -the Female Integrated Treatment (FIT) Program and a series of other nonresidential, genderspecific programs. The FIT Program includes programs reviewed in other chapters of this report, i.e., the Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP) (Chapter 8), Resolve Program (Chapter 6), and Vocational Training Program (Chapter 3); however, in this instance these programs are offered in an integrated, institution-wide treatment setting. The FIT Program is specifically described in Program Statement 5240.01 Female Integrated Treatment , whereas the other programs in this section are more generally referenced in Program Statement 5200.07 Female Offender Manual (WSPB, 2022; WSPB, 2022).

Incarcerated women represent approximately 7% of the BOP's population.  Research suggests incarcerated women present with different risk factors, to include higher rates of mental health problems, serious mental illnesses, trauma, and substance use disorders (Green et al., 2005; James &amp; Glaze, 2006; Stead et al., 2009; Lynch et al., 2012).  Recognizing these issues, the BOP

offers gender-specific programming in these areas, as noted in previous chapters of this report. In addition, the BOP also offers this group of gender-responsive programs, focused largely on women's self-esteem and interpersonal relationships.  The following quotation from the Council of State Government Justice Center's resource guide, Adopting a Gender-Responsive Approach for Women in the Justice System , summarizes the rationale for implementing these specific types of correctional programs:

'Women  often  get  into  and  out  of  the  criminal  justice  system  in  the  context  of  unhealthy relationships  (e.g.,  a  male  partner  who  encourages  substance  use  or  prostitution)  or  familial obligations. Research on female psychological development illuminates how women's identity, self-worth,  and  sense  of  empowerment  are  defined  by  and  through  their  relationships  with others. In contrast, men's major developmental issues are achieving autonomy and independence.' (Fleming et al., 2021, p. 10).

Women's  programs  are  primarily  supported  by  the Women and  Special  Populations  Branch (WSPB) in the Reentry Services Division (RSD), although the Psychology Services Branch (PSB) and Education Services Branch (ESB) play a significant role in supporting the FIT Program. In BOP institutions, staff from different departments may facilitate women's programs. Specific staffing requirements for each program are noted in the program descriptions.

## 13.1.1  Identifying Women's Needs

The women's programs in this chapter address a wide range of needs.  Procedures for assessing each of these needs have been described in other chapters of this report. Of note, the BOP relies on the same needs assessment tools for both men and women. No gender-responsive needs assessment tools are utilized. Readers are referred to the following chapters to learn more about assessment procedures for needs addressed in these programs: work (Chapter 3), mental health (Chapter  5),  trauma  (Chapter  6),  antisocial  peers  and  cognitions  (Chapter  7),  substance  use (chapter  8),  family/parenting  (Chapter  10),  finance/poverty  (Chapter  11),  recreation/leisure/ fitness (Chapter 12).

## 13.2 Women's Program Descriptions

As noted above, the women 's programs in this chapter include an intensive residential treatment program and eight nonresidential programs. These programs serve different target populations with  unique  programming  needs,  all  of  which  are  approached  from  a  gender-responsive perspective.

The below table outlines key features of the BOP's nine women's programs addressed in this chapter, including the target population, needs addressed, and program dosage. In addition, the table  notes  the  number  of  institutions  offering  the  program  and  the  number  of  individual participating in the program at the close of FY 2023. Lastly the table provides an estimate of the percentage of the target population served by the program to date. Specifically, this estimate compares the total number of program participants and graduates in custody to the total number of individuals in custody with a potential need for such a program. This estimate represents an educated guess, as we did not have access to data allowing for perfect one-to-one comparisons of needs and programs. Following the table, each education program is described in detail.

## Residential Treatment Program

## 13.2.1  Female Integrated Treatment Program

The Female Integrated Treatment (FIT) Program is classified by the BOP as an EBRR Program.  This institution-wide residential program  provides  integrated  treatment  for  women,  offering cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for substance use disorders, trauma-related disorders, and other  mental  disorders,  as  well  as  vocational  training,  in  a  modified  therapeutic  community (MTC) setting (BOP, 2022). The program was developed by the BOP in 2016 to provide integrated care for women.  The program was originally implemented at FCI Danbury, CT and later expanded to SFF Hazelton, WV and FCI Tallahassee, FL (BOP, 2023). Although not referenced in the most recent  edition  of  the  FSA Approved  Programs  Guide,  the  BOP's  internal  website  notes an additional Spanish-speaking program at FMC Carswell, TX is launching in 2023 (BOP, n.d.).  A primary  stated  goal  of  the  program  is  'to  create  a  holistic,  female -specific  community  that addresses  priority  needs  for  women,  including  trauma  informed  care,  other  types  of  mental health treatment, substance use treatmen t, and educational/vocational skills' ( WSPB, 2022). The target population for the program is women with multiple needs, i.e., antisocial peers, cognitions, mental health, substance use, trauma, and/or work.

The  FIT  Program  is  a  500-hour,  trauma-informed,  gender  responsive  treatment  program. Typically,  participants  receive  at  least  15  contact  hours  of  treatment  per  week,  although participants may receive fewer hours based on their needs and stage in treatment (WSPB, 2022). Program  length  is  determined  individually  based  on  the  participant's  needs  and  interest  in treatment. Typically, intensive, half-day programming lasts from 9-12 months and participants may remain in mental health or maintenance programming indefinitely (BOP, n.d.). As noted above, the residential program is integrated into the entire institution and operate as an MTC. The program is multidisciplinary and incorporates multiple interventions into a single treatment model. Participants in the programming unit must be engaged in the program, either by actively participating,  waiting  for  admission,  or  having  completed  the  program.    Three  stand-alone programs  are  incorporated  into  the  FIT  Program -the  RDAP,  the  Resolve  Program,  and  a Vocational Training Program.  To learn more about these programs components we refer readers

to  Chapters 8, 6,  and  3  respectively.  To  participate  in  these  individual  program  components, participants must meet admission criteria outlined in the applicable policies. The program also addresses  criminal  thinking,  by  identifying  criminal  thinking  errors  and  promoting  prosocial interactions  with  staff  and  peers  (BOP,  2022).  In  addition,  the  Vocational  Training  Program opportunities include work as peer companions, leading to employment as a Peer Specialist in the community. Individuals at non-FIT Program institutions are informed about the program, and transfer requests are authorized for interested and qualified individuals.

The FIT Program includes the following core elements: assessment via a psychosocial interview, development of an individualized treatment/goal plan, cognitive-behavioral interventions using program journals and protocols, targeting of criminogenic needs and vocational needs, traumainformed care, and the MTC as described in Program Statement 5330.11 Psychology Treatment Programs (WSPB, 2022; PSB, 2016). Supportive interventions consistent with Program Statement 5310.16 Treatment and Care of Inmates with Mental Illness and Program Statement 5200.06 Management of Inmates with Disabilities are also available as applicable. Individuals enrolled in the program are eligible for achievement awards if they fulfill all programming requirements.

The program has dedicated staff facilitators -program coordinators and treatment specialists. Staff  facilitators  are  provided  with  training  consistent  with  the  interventions  they  deliver.  As noted above, the program is explicitly described in BOP policy, specifically in Program Statement 5240.01  Female  Integrated  Treatment ,  as  well  as  in Program  Statement  5330.11  Psychology Treatment Programs . Program resources are available on the BOP's internal website, including guidance  related  to  programming  schedules,  SENTRY  assignments,  referrals,  forms,  and supplemental resources from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and other sources (n.d.). Specific Program Review Guidelines are associated with the program  to  ensure  fidelity  to  the  model.  Successful  completion  of  the  program  is  based  on attendance, participation, and achievement of treatment plan goals. In addition to improving institutional adjustment and reducing symptoms of mental illness and substance use disorders, the program's anticipated outcomes are a reduction in misconduct and a reduction in recidivism. Program outcomes are not formally measured.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the FIT Program is described as available at 3 female institutions -FCI Danbury, FCI Hazelton and FCI Tallahassee - and at the close of FY 2023 the program was available at all 3 institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, 155 individuals were enrolled in the program and 57 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of  FY  2023,  there  were  200  individuals  participating  in  the  program,  up  from  156  individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 2.48% of women in the BOP either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program

since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## NonResidential Women's Programs

The BOP offers a series of non-residential programs targeted to the needs of women. One of these  programs  is  explicitly  referenced  in  policy -the  Foundation  Program,  whereas  the remaining  programs  are  not  directly  referenced.  While  these  additional  programs  are  not explicitly referenced in policy, they do meet policy requirements associated with programming for female offenders. Programming for women is generally referenced in Program Statement 5200.07 Female Offenders Manual (WSPB, 2022).  Institutions are required to offer a minimum of  one  gender-responsive  program  per  quarter  and  these  programs  are  noted  to  meet  this requirement. However, institutions are provided considerable latitude, in that they may choose not to implement a particular program.

## 13.2.2  Foundation Program

The Foundation Program is classified by the BOP as an EBRR Program (BOP, 2022). The program is 'designed  to  assist  women  in  assessing  and  advocating  for  their  individual  needs  and translating results of that assessment into the selection of programs and plans to meet their reentry  goals  (BOP,  2022).  The  program  was  originally  developed  by  the  BOP  in  2015,  and program content was subsequently refined in collaboration with The Change Companies. The program was developed as an enhanced admissions and orientation program for women, to raise awareness about programming opportunities and encourage participation in these opportunities as  appropriate.  The  stated  goal  of  the  program  is  to  help  women  chart  a  healthy  path  for themselves during their incarceration. The target population for the program is newly designated women  and  the  program  is  delivered  at  the  beginning  of  an  individual's  sentence.  Needs addressed in the program include cognitions, education, mental health, and work (BOP, 2022).

The Foundation Program is a 15-hour program aimed at exploring issues facing women. Per the BOP (2022), in this program women 'have the opportunity to identify positive changes that will lead to a successful reentry, and consider programs and services within the facility that can help them make these changes.'  Program modules address the following topic areas:  pathways to prison, the psychology of women, women and addiction, women and relationships, women as caretakers, women in the workforce, women's health, women's fitness, and women as returning citizens.  In each module, participants learn more about potential risk factors and the needs of incarcerated  women,  to  include  BOP  resources  available  to  address  these  issues.  In  a  final session, participants develop and review their personal priority plans.  The personal priority plan is  based  on  each  individual's  understanding  of  their  personal  risks  and  needs  and  the  means

available to address these needs.  The curriculum is provided via a facilitator guide, a series of Powerpoint  presentations,  and  an  interactive  participant  journal  developed  by  the  Change Companies. Of note, the Change Plan Program, detailed below, is a follow-up PA Program focused on addressing goals established in the Foundation Program.

The program does not have dedicated staff facilitators. According to the BOP, the program may be facilitated  by  a  special  populations  coordinator,  social  worker,  or  reentry  affairs  specialist (BOP, 2023). In addition, subject matter experts in the institution may serve as guest presenters addressing their areas of expertise.  No special training is provided for facilitators. The program is  briefly  described  in Program  Statement  5200.07  Female  Offender  Manual (WSPB,  2022). Specifically,  this  policy  notes  the program  is  'designed  to  assist  women  in  assessing  their individual needs and translating that information into attainable goals while building a supportive community'.  The  policy  also  notes  the  program  is  to  be  offered  at  least  once  annually  at minimum, low, administrative, and pretrial facilities for women. It is to be used for women at the beginning of the service of their sentences to help them plan future program choices. Successful completion  of  the  program  is  based  on  attendance  and  participation  in  90%  of  sessions, completion of 90% of homework assignments, and completion of a personal priorities plan and group  community  service  project.  In  addition  to  improving  institutional  adjustment,  the program's  anticipated  outcomes  are  a  reduction  in  recidivis m.    Program  outcomes  are  not formally measured.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Foundation Program is described as available at all  female  institutions;  however,  at  the  close  of  FY  2023  the  program  was  offered  at  11 institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, 428 individuals were enrolled in the program and 569 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 144 individuals participating in the program, up from 121 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 10.83% of women in the BOP either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 13.2.3  Change Plan Program

The Change Plan Program is a PA Program and follow-up program to the Foundation Program. At the conclusion of the Foundation Program, participants identify three positive changes they want to make via a personal priorities plan. The Change Plan Program focuses on one of these changes, 'guiding p articipants through 10 evidencebased strategies they can apply to this change' (BOP, 2022). The program was developed by the BOP in collaboration with The Change Companies. The stated goal of the program is to facilitate positive change. The target population for the program is women who have completed the Foundation Program and are ready to begin working toward

their goals. Needs addressed in the program include cognitions, education, mental health and/or work need.

The Change Plan Program is a 15-hour, program consisting of a combination of lectures, class discussions, and homework assignments. Program modules address the following topic areas: how we change; learn the facts; get involved; notice your effect on others; explore your feelings; look within; make a commitment; reward yourself; think, feel and act in responsible ways; avoid triggers; ask for help; and my change plan. Resources for the Change Plan Program include an interactive  journal  and  facilitator  guide,  developed  by  The  Change  Companies,  as  well  as  a supplemental DVD.

The  program  does  not  have  a  dedicated  staff  facilitator.  According  to  the  BOP  (2022),  the program may be facilitated by a variety of staff, including Education, Health Services, Psychology, or Unit Team Staff, special programs coordinators, and contractors or volunteers.  No formal training is required to facilitate the course, nor does the agency provide any formal training to facilitators, apart from the facilitator guide. Successful completion of the program is based on attendance  and  participation.  The program's  anticipated  outcome  is  the  acquisition  of  skills required to meet established goals. Program outcomes are not formally measured.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Change Plan Program is described as available at  all  female  institutions;  however,  at  the  close  of  FY  2023  the  program  was  offered  at  5 institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, 149 individuals were enrolled in the program and 272  individuals  completed  the  program  (BJS,  2022).  At  the  close  of  FY  2023,  there  were  32 individuals participating in the program, down from 81 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 3.92% of women in the BOP either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 13.2.4  Assert Yourself for Female Offenders Program

The Assert Yourself for Female Offenders Program is an EBRR Program promoting interpersonal effectiveness and targeting behavior that can lead women to feel helpless about their lives (BOP, 2022).  The program was developed by Centre for Clinical Interventions (2019), a component of the  government  of  Western  Australia.  The  BOP  adapted  the  program  for  a  correctional population.  The stated goal of the program is to teach women to be assertive, while respecting the boundaries of others. The target population for this program is women, especially survivors of abuse who struggle with low self-esteem. Per the BOP, needs addressed by this program are cognitions and family/parenting.

The program is an 8-session psychoeducational course consisting of a combination of lectures, class  discussions,  skills  practice,  and  homework  assignments.  Program  modules  address  the following topic areas:  what is assertiveness; how to think more assertively; how to behave more assertively; how to say no assertively and how to complement assertively; how to deal assertively with criticism; how to deal with disappointment assertively; and putting it all together (WSPB, n.d.).    Resources  for  the  program  include  a  facilitator  guide  and  participant  manual,  made available to institutions via Sallyport.

The  program  does  not  have  a  dedicated  staff  facilitator.  According  to  the  BOP  (2022),  the program may be facilitated by a variety of staff, including special programs coordinators, case managers, and correctional counselors. No formal training is required  to facilitate the course. Successful completion of the program is based on attendance and participation in 88% of the sessions, as well as completion of homework assignments and pre-/post-program surveys. The program's anticipated  outcome is a reduction in symptoms of low self-esteem and passivity, which in turn is expected to improve institutional adjustment, reduce misconduct, and reduce recidivism.  Program outcomes are not formally measured.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Assert Yourself for Female Offenders Program is described as available at all female institutions; however, at the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 14 institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, 680 individuals were enrolled in the program and 929 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 177 individuals participating in the program, down from 214 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 18.10% of women in the  BOP  either  (1)  are  enrolled  in  the  program  or  (2)  have  completed  the  program  since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 13.2.5 Women's Relationships I Program

The Women's Relationships Program is a PA Program designed to assist 'women in identifying and developing healthy, prosocial relationships with friends, family, and acquaintances' (BOP, 2022).  The  program  was  developed  by  the  BOP.    The  stated  goal  of  the  program  is  the development of a greater understandi ng of one's relationships. The target population for this program is women with relationship issues and a need in one of these three areas:  antisocial peers, cognitions, and family/parenting.

The  5-hour  educational  program  consists  of  a  combination  of  lectures  and  class  discussions. Program modules address the following topic areas:  relationships and communication, setting healthy  boundaries,  relationship  with  self,  relationships  inside  prison,  relationships  outside

prison, and relationships in transition. Resources for the program include a facilitator guide and participant manual developed by the Change Companies.  Each program module includes new material, an activity, group discussion, and a behavioral or practical homework assignment which is discussed in the next session.

The  program  does  not  have  a  dedicated  staff  facilitator.  According  to  the  BOP  (2022),  the program  may  be  facilitated  by  a  variety  of  staff,  including  special  programs  coordinators, Education  staff,  contractors,  and  volunteers.  No  formal  training  is  required  to  facilitate  the course, nor does the agency provide any formal training to facilitators, apart from the facilitator guide.  Successful completion of the program is based on 100% attendance and participation, as well as completion of the program survey. The program's anticipated outcome is a reduction in the symptoms of unhealthy relationships. Program outcomes are not formally measured.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Women's Relationships I Program is described as available at all female institutions; however, at the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 4 institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, 424 individuals were enrolled in the program and 547 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 37 individuals  participating  in  the  program,  consistent  with  37  individuals  participating  in  the program at the close of FY 2022. At present, 7.26% of women in the BOP either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023). It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 13.2.6 Women's Relationships II Program

The  Women's  Relationships  II  Program  is  a  PA Program  examining  the  relationships  of incarcerated women (BOP, 2022). This program is a followup to the Women's Relationships I Program. The program was developed by the BOP, in collaboration with the Change Companies. The stated goal of the program is to further understand and improve relationships. The target population  for  this  program  is  women  with  needs  in  these  four  areas:    antisocial  peers, cognitions, family/parenting, and trauma.

The program is a 7-part gender-responsive and trauma-informed series for women. The program consists of 74 hours of programming, including a combination of lectures and class discussions. The  program  'explores  self -image,  connections  with  others,  building  healthy  relationships, communication techniques and the transitioning of relationships' (BOP, 2022).  Resources for the program include a facilitator guide and participant manual, available to institutions from the Change  Companies.    The  7  interactive  journals  include:    (1)  W omen's Relationships,  which explores  and  strengthens  relationship  inside  and  outside  of  prison,  (2)  Whom  Am  I?  which strengthens one's relationship with themselves, (3) How I Connect with Others, which addresses

past and present relationships including strategies to create and connect relationships, (4) My Closest  Relationships,  which  examines  experiences  in  five  areas  of  closeness  and  how  to strengthen these areas, (5) How I Think and Feel, which looks at patterns of thinking and how to manage feelings, (6) How I Communicate, which focuses on listening skills, body language, and speaking style, and (7) Who I Am Becoming, which address progress and future goals (WSPB, n.d.).  The entire program is completed within 12 months.

The  program  does  not  have  a  dedicated  staff  facilitator.  According  to  the  BOP  (2022),  the program  may  be  facilitated  by  a  variety  of  staff,  including  special  programs  coordinators, Education  staff,  contractors,  and  volunteers.  No  formal  training  is  required  to  facilitate  the course; however, experience with group facilitation is desired.  Successful completion of the program  is  based  on  attendance  and  participation.  The  program's  anticipated  outcome  is  a reduction  in  the  symptoms  of  unhealthy  relationships.  Program  outcomes  are  not  formally measured.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Women's Relationships II Program is described as available at all female institutions; however, at the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 9 institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, 358 individuals were enrolled in the program and 591 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 189 individuals participating in the program, down significantly from 489 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 7.95% of women in the BOP  either  (1)  are  enrolled  in  the  program  or  (2)  have  completed  the  program  since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 13.2.7  Understanding Your Feelings: Shame and Low Self-Esteem Program

The Understanding Your Feelings: Shame and Low Self-Esteem Program is a PA Program aimed at helping women 'evaluate the role of shame and low self esteem in their lives' (BOP, 2022). -The program was developed by Phoenix Resources and is available for use in the BOP based on a site-specific  license.    The  program  aims  to  increase  individu als'  understanding  of  the  factors underlying  shame  and  low  self-esteem,  as  well  as  their  ability  to  manage  these  feelings  and improve their sense of self-worth.  The target population for this program is women with needs in the following areas:  cognitions, mental health, and trauma.

The 7-hour program relies on an interactive journal and group discussion.  According to the BOP (2022), 'risk factors are identified for each individual, and coping skills to improve self -worth are learned and practiced.'  Resources for the program include a participant workbook f rom A New Freedom: Phoenix Resources entitle Understanding Your Feelings: Shame and Low Self-Esteem,

which is made available to institutions via Sallyport. The workbook explores the origins of feelings of  shame  and  low  self-esteem,  triggers  for  these  feelings,  and  cognitive-behaviorally  based strategies to modify these feelings (Phoenix Resources, 1996).

The  program  does  not  have  a  dedicated  staff  facilitator.  According  to  the  BOP  (2022),  the program  may  be  facilitated  by  a  variety  of  staff,  including  special  programs  coordinators, Education  and  Health  Services  staff.  No  formal  training  is  required  to  facilitate  the  course. Successful completion of the program is based on attendance and participation. The program's anticipated outcome is a reduction in the symptoms of shame and low self-esteem. Program outcomes are not formally measured.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Understanding Your Feelings: Shame and Low Self-Esteem Program is described as available at all female institutions; however, at the close of FY  2023  the  program  was  offered  at  13  institutions  (BOP,  2023).  In  calendar  year  2021,  344 individuals were enrolled in the program and 663 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 146 individuals participating in the program, consistent with 143 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present,  18.88%  of  women  in  the  BOP  either  (1)  are  enrolled  in  the  program  or  (2)  have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).   It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 13.2.8  Square One Program

The  Square  One:  Essentials for  Women  Program  is  a  PA  Program 'designed  to  teach  female offenders basic life skills (BOP, 2022). Cognitive-behavioral approaches and interactive journaling are incorporated into the program. The program was developed by the BOP. The stated goal of the program is to aid in the development of a basic life skills. The target population for this program is lower functioning women, and/or those who have not lived or worked independently. Needs addressed by the program include finance/poverty, mental health, and recreation/leisure/fitness.

The  program  is  a  12-hour  educational  course  consisting  of  a  combination  of  lectures,  group discussions, and homework assignments. Program modules address the following topic areas: hygiene, nutrition, exercise, housing, childcare, academics, professional skills, and social support and  relationships  (WSPB,  n.d.).    Each  module  begins  with  a  rationale  for  the  importance  of addressing the topic, then proceeds to offering options to develop skills and address needs in this area,  to  include  a  list  of  available  BOP  resources.    Each  module  is  delivered  via  a  90-minute interactive group session, with the presentation of basic educational material by the facilitator and group discussion of this material paired with interactive journaling exercises.  Resources for

the program include a facilitator's guide and participant workbook, made available to institutions via Sallyport.

The  program  does  not  have  a  dedicated  staff  facilitator.  According  to  the  BOP  (2022),  the program may be facilitated by a variety of staff, including staff from the following departments: Business  Office,  Education,  Health  Services,  Unit  Team  staff,  as  well  as  special  programs coordinators, contractors, and volunteers. No formal training is required to facilitate the course. Successful completion of the program is based on attendance and participation. The program's anticipated outcome is the development of basic life skills for reentry.  Program outcomes are not formally measured.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Square One Program is described as available at all female institutions; however, at the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 4 institutions (BOP,  2023).  In  calendar  year  2021,  220  individuals  were  enrolled  in  the  program  and  387 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 50 individuals participating in the program, down from 63 individuals participating in the program at the close of  FY  2022  (BOP,  2023;  BOP,  2022).  At  present,  10.92%  of  women  in  the  BOP  either  (1)  are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 13.2.9 Women's Reflection Group Program

The Women's Reflections Group Program is a PA Program for 'women who are struggling to make good choices,  may  be  transitioning  from  special  housing,  or  are  experiencing  difficulty addressing environmental stressors' (BOP, 2022). The program was developed by the BOP.  The stated goal of the program is to help members gain insight into their thoughts and behaviors. The target population for this program is women with needs in these areas:  antisocial peers and cognitions.  The  BOP's  internal  website  notes  the  program  is  applicable  to  the  following populations:  women in restrictive housing, releasing from restricting housing, detention centers, or newly designated following a detention center placement (WSPB, n.d.).

The  36-hour  program  relies  heavily  on  journaling  activities,  which  may  be  discussed  with  a facilitator one-on-one or in an openended group, depending on the woman's current placement (WSPB, n.d.). Once a woman releases from restrictive housing, she may enter the open-ended group to complete the journaling activities.  The program 'gives incarcerated women a safe and comfortable  place  where  they  can  process  problems  and  emotional  concerns  they  are experiencing and gain tools needed to work toward solving th ese programs' (BOP, 2022). Topic areas  addressed  in  the  reflections  journal  include  accomplishment,  courage,  choice,  selfcompassion,  wisdom,  love  and  friendship,  personal  growth,  and  gratitude  (WSPB,  n.d.).

Resources for the program include a facilitator guide and participant manual, made available to institutions via Sallyport.

The  program  does  not  have  a  dedicated  staff  facilitator.  According  to  the  BOP  (2022),  the program may be facilitated by a special programs coordinator or reentry affairs coordinator.  No formal  training  is  required  to  facilitate  the  course,  nor  does  the  agency  provide  any  formal training  to  facilitators.  Successful  completion  of  the  program  is  based  on  attendance  and participation.  The  program's anticipated outcome  is improved institutional adjustment and a reduction  in  unhealthy  choices  and  their  negative  consequences.  Program  outcomes  are  not formally measured.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Women's Reflection Group Program is described as available at all female institutions; however, at the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 10 institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, no individuals were enrolled in the program and no individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 75 individuals participating in the program, up from 49 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 2.30% of women in the BOP either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 13.3 Study Identification Procedures

To  create  our  study  database,  we  first  attempted  to  identify  all  published  meta-analyses  or systematic  reviews  of  prisonbased  women's  programs published  during  our  review  period (2000-2022). Based on this search, we identified four meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the  empirical  literature  on  women's  programming  within  correctional  settings ,  including  one meta-analysis also included in Chapter 6 of this report.  See Appendix Table 13A for an overview of these meta-analyses and systematic reviews. As noted in Chapter 1, a strong argument can be made evaluations of prison-based women's programs operating in the 1990's and earlier are not relevant today, because of changes over time in program design components and incarcerated populations. In fact, the programs addressed in this chapter were developed in the 2000's and later. In addition, many of the studies contained in these meta-analyses and systematic reviews were addressed in other chapters of this report, as they involve programming categories serving both  men  and  women,  e.g.,  trauma  programs,  substance  use  treatment  programs.  As  noted previously,  this  chapter  focuses  on  programming  available  exclusively  to  women,  for  which comparable programming for men does not exist.

We then searched a series  of  electronic  databases  in  an  effort  to  identify  individual  studies relevant to this portion of our review.  We searched the following databases:

- · APA PsycINFO
- · Academic Search Premier
- · Criminal Justice Abstracts
- · MEDLINE
- · JSTOR
- · Education Research Complete
- · ScienceDirect
- · Springer Nature Journals
- · Political Science Complete

We used the following search terms for our systematic search of electronic databases:

(women OR females) AND (services OR programs OR intervention) AND (prison OR jail OR incarceration OR imprisonment OR correction facilities) AND (recidivism OR reoffending OR repeat offenders) NOT (youth OR adolescents OR children OR teens)

Specific women's programs in this chapter were also keyed into the database search replacing the  first  two  clusters  of  key words  on  women's  programming  with:  'FIT  Program',  'Assert Yourself  for  Female  Offenders',  'Foundation',  'Change  Plan',  'Square  One  Essentials  for Women', 'Understanding Your Feelings', 'Women's Reflection Group', 'Women's Relationships I', and 'Women's Relationships II'. Each unique search yielded 0 new hits.

This search yielded 252 hits, but that number was reduced to 244 studies due to duplicates across the databases. Visual inspection of the titles and abstracts by the research team further reduced the number of potential studies to  37 requiring in-depth review.  Specifically, we focused on studies that included one of the outcomes measures described in Chapter 1, identified a control group for comparison, and addressed the type of programming contained in this chapter, e.g., relationships, communication skills, understanding feelings. A number of the studies identified in this  search  were  identified  in  previous  searches  involving  programming  addressed  in  other chapters of this report. For this reason, they were not considered relevant to this chapter.

The majority of the 37 studies we examined in-depth did not meet our review criteria and were excluded.  A  total  of  six  studies  addressing  programming  consistent  with  this  chapter  were identified for inclusion in our review.

Based on our review of the studies included in the four meta-analyses and systematic reviews highlighted in Appendix Table 13A along with the results of our searches of electronic databases, we identified six evaluations of prisonbased women's programs relevant to this chapter from

the period 2000 to 2022 that meet our review criteria (see Appendix Table 13B for an overview o f each study, as well as overviews of women's program studies more broadly).

## 13.4 Evaluations of Women's Programs in the BOP

We  did  not  identify  any  recent  internal  of  external  evaluation  research  (2000-2022)  that examined the effects of participation in one or more of BOP's w omen's programs. Recognizing the lack of evaluation on its current program offerings, the BOP -with research funding support from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) -has contracted with the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) and the Urban Institute to conduct an external evaluation of the following two women's programs: the FIT and Foundation Programs. The research was initiated at the end of FY 2022, and the study has an anticipated completion date of FY 2027. Researchers plan to measure both the  in-prison  effects  of  the  program  (e.g.,  reduction  in  mental  health  crises  and  disciplinary actions), and post-release recidivism outcomes. In addition, BOP has indicated that it plans to contract  with  an  external  evaluator  to  assess  its  third  EBRR  Program  in  this  area,  the  Assert Yourself for Female Offenders Program. This contract has an anticipated award date of FY 2025. One  final  note:  since  the  start  of  our  review,  BOP  has  created  five  new  women-focused programs 1 ,  but  we  would  place  only  one  of  these  programs  in  this  substantive  category:  the Women's Life Skills Program. It is classified by the BOP as an EBRR program. As we highlight in the  following  section,  there  is  very  little  evaluation  research  conducted  outside  BOP  on  the effectiveness of these four types of women's programs.

## 13.5 Evaluations of Women's Programs Outside BOP

In this section, we review the small body of recent research (2000-2022) related to the evaluation of the specific types of w omen's programs currently operated by BOP that were conducted in other settings (e.g., in state prisons across the USA, or in the prisons systems of other countries). We are only focusing on a subset of all available women's programming in this chapter: programs that  resemble  one  of BOP's  3  EBRR Programs  for  women,  which  includes  one  multi-modal residential  treatment  program (the FIT Program), targeting substance use, trauma, and work needs;  and  two  low  dosage  (8  and  15  hours) nonresidential  women's  programs targeting cognitions. We will also examine evaluations of programs that appear to be similar to the five nonresidential, low dosage programs (ranging from 5-74 hours) for women classified by the BOP

as  PA  Programs.  These  programs  focused  on  a  variety  of  needs,  including  anti-social  peers, family/parenting, and cognitions.

Appendix Table 13A highlights the findings from four separate systematic reviews of the broad body of research evidence on the effectiveness of women's programming in institutional settings , while Appendix Table 13B includes six evaluations of the specific types of programs included in this review area, along with the 50 plus evaluations we have reviewed elsewhere in this report, including    1  evaluation  of  a  prison  industry  program  for  women,  14  evaluations  of  trauma programs for women, 7 evaluations of CBT programs for women that address mental/behavioral disorders, 10 evaluations of substance use programs for women, 3 evaluations of faith-based programs  for  women,  5  evaluations  of  health  and  wellness  programs  for  women,  and  18 evaluations of special population programs for women. While these evaluations cover program areas we review elsewhere, they are included here for those readers interested in the effects of a full range of programs offered for women.

After  reviewing  the  systematic  reviews  included  in  Appendix  Table  13A,  we  found  that  they provided moderate  evidence  of the effectiveness -both for in-prison and post-release outcomes-- of a wide range of prison programs. However, these reviews provided little or no research evidence regarding the types of women's programs currently being offered by the BOP. For example, Tripodi et al. (2011) focused on 24 studies examining the effects of interventions for  incarcerated  women ;  none  of  these  studies  evaluated  programs  like  the  BOP  women's programs under review. Similarly, both Bartlet et al. (2015) and Galway et al. (2022) focused on evaluations  that  we  reviewed  in  other  chapters  of  this  report;  none  of  the  evaluations  they reviewed were relevant to programs in this review area. Only Gobell et al. (2016) included one study that was applicable to this review area. We include this study (Schram &amp; Morash, 2002) in Appendix Table 13B.

Appendix  Table  13B  includes  six  studies  that  appear  similar -in  their  focus  on  psychosocial support-to BOP's nonresidential programs for women described earlier in this chapter; but only two of these studies met our minimum review standard (level 3 or above quality rating). These two studies are highlighted below.

Fernandez et al. (2022) conducted a small (n=96), randomized control trial (RCT) that examined the  in-prison  effect  of  a  16-session  Emotional  Education  and  Health  program  offered  in  one Spanish prison. Researchers reported pre-post improvements in several quality-of-life measures (self-esteem,  resilience,  assertiveness,  emotional  intelligence).  The  unique  feature  of  this program is that program was centered on the provision of support services by nurses. Fernandez and colleagues (2022, 107), offer the following rationale for this nurse-centered intervention:

'Specific  intervention  programs  of  emotional  education  for  prisoners  conducted  by  nursing professionals are difficult to find, and studies that provide results on the degree of efficacy of these programs on the clinical variables of these patients are even scarcer. Because of the lack of studies about these topics, combined with the knowledge that a nurse is very often the only health support  provider  for  the  prisoner  (Kristofersson  &amp;  Kaas,  2013),  it  is  believed  that  the  implementation  of  an  emotional  education  program  coming  from  the  area  of  nursing  would  be beneficial for the health of the prisoners, who in their professional roles, are their patients'.

The second study (Torkaman et al., 2020) conducted a small (n=84) randomized control trial (RCT) of the  impact of a short-term (including eight 90-minute sessions) transactional analysis program 2 on  the  self-esteem  of  incarcerated  women  in  a  prison  in  Southeast  Iran.  The  research  was described as follows: ' The TA trainings were presented by the first researcher, a psychologist, a nursing PhD, and a psychiatric nurse using educational slides, lectures, group discussions, as well as  questions  and  answers.  The  control  group  received  no  training  during  the  study  period. ' 2020,3).  While  the  study  had  several  limitations,  the  results  appear  to  support  strategies designed to improve the self-esteem of women in prison.

Although  none  of  the  evaluations  we  reviewed  included  multimodal  women's  residential programs, we decided to classify the effects of the FIT program as mixed , because two of three individual components of the FIT program (RDAP and Vocational Training Program) have been classified as effective 3 elsewhere in this review (see Table 13B for an overview of these studies). The evaluation results for the nonresidential women's programs we reviewed identified in -prison effects only. With only two studies meeting our review criteria, we classify the in-prison effects of  the  nonresidential  women's  programs  as promising . The  post-release  effects  of  these nonresidential programs are classified as unknown .

We direct readers with an interest in the evidence base for women's programming more broadly core programming chapters contained in this report. In addition, the below table summarizes our findings related to gender-responsive women's programs in other programming categories.

## 13.6 Women's Programs Comparability Assessment

In  this  section,  we  compare  the  BOP 's specialized women's programs to evaluated  women's programs  in  other  jurisdictions.  With  respect  to  the  FIT  Program,  we  returned  to  our comparability  assessments  of  the  components  of  this  program  -  the  RDAP,  Resolve,  and Vocational Training Programs. We found the RDAP to be comparable to evaluated residential substance use treatment programs in other jurisdictions with respect to a number of key features - the MTC model, CBT-based interventions, focus on relapse prevention, duration and dosage, staffing,  and  community-based  aftercare.  We  found  the  Resolve  Program  to  be  somewhat comparable  to  evaluated  programs  in  other  jurisdictions.  Most  of  the  Resolve  Program components were developed outside of the BOP and adopted by the BOP in a manner consistent with their developer's model . Although our review did not identify prison-based evaluations of all the Resolve Program components, we did find evaluations supporting a rating of somewhat comparable for this program. Lastly, with respect to the Vocational Training Program, we found this program to be very comparable to evaluated programs, serving a similar target population, with similar program curricula, instructor qualifications, program content and dosage, and skillsbased outcome measures. Therefore, we concluded the FIT Program is comparable to evaluated programs in other jurisdictions.

For  the  remaining  programs  in  this  chapter,  there  were  only  two  program  evaluations  to consider, and only one of the evaluated programs bears some similarity to a BOP Program. The Emotional  Education  and  Health  Program  evaluated  by  Fernandez  et  al.  (2022)  shares  some similarities with the BOP's Assert Yourself for Female Offenders Program. Both programs address assertiveness training, to include the underpinnings of assertive behavior. Both programs are relatively  low  dose  interventions,  although  the  BOP's Assert  Yourself  for  Female  Offenders Program at 8 programming hours is half the dose of the Emotional Education and Health Program at 16 programming hours. Other important differences between the two programs include the target populations and staffing of the programs. The BOP's Assert Yourself for Female Offenders serves a broader target population  of women in need of assertiveness training, whereas the

Emotional Education and Health Program focuses on women with an identified pathology. The Emotional Education and Health Program is staffed by nurses, whereas the BOP's Assert Yourself for Female Offenders may be facilitated by a variety of staff, but nurses are not identified as one of  the  staffing  options.  For  these  reasons,  we  rate  the  two  programs  as  only  somewhat comparable.

The other evaluated program in our review, the Transactional Analysis Group Training Program evaluated by Torkaman et al. (2020), is not like any of the BOP programs in this category. None of the BOP programs rely on this intervention - transactional analysis.

## 13.7 Women's Programs Recommendations

In  addition  to  conducting  a  review  of  the  evaluation  research  and  offering  an  assessment  of whether specific programs should be designated as either EBRR Programs or PA Programs, the Global Corrections Group is tasked with 'informing future First Step Act program updates/revisions'. To this end, we offer the following recommendations.

Some of the women's programs discussed in this chapter are very low dose interventions - the Assert Yourself for Female Offenders (8 hours), Understanding Your Feelings: Shame and Low Self-Esteem (7 hours), and Women's Relationships I (5 hours) Programs. It is very unlikely such low  dose  interventions  will  produce  lasting  behavioral  change.  Consequently,  it  raises  the question whether these programs are a costeffective use of the BOP's limited resources.  In addition,  classifying  Assert  Yourself  for  Female  Offenders  as  an  EBRR  Program  may  be problematic, as the limited empirical support found for this type of programming involved twice the  dosage  of  the  BOP's  program.  At  such  a low  dosage,  it  is  unlikelihood  this  program  will produce lasting behavioral change and/or impact the risk of recidivism.  Perhaps bundling these low dose programs into a more comprehensive gender-based, self-esteem, relationships, and communication skills intervention would yield more favorable results.  These programs share some common themes, which might be integrated into a single higher dose program, especially if paired with more opportunities for skills-based practice.

The  Foundation  and  Change  Plan  Programs  are  unique  interventions  designed  to  encourage participation  in  additional  programming,  targeted  to  an  individual's  specific  needs.  This  pre -treatment intervention may have value, by ensuring individuals are motivated for treatment and directed to programs appropriate for their specific needs.  However, we did not find support for its classification as an EBRR Program. The Foundation Program is presently under evaluation, and this evaluation will inform the BOP's clas sification of this program as an EBRR Program. We would note incarcerated women often participate in programming at relatively high rates, as compared to men. For example, Crittenden and Koons-Witt (2017) found higher rates of participation for

women than men in the following programming areas: educational programs, vocational training programs, mental health programs, parenting programs, and life skills programs.  Given these findings, empirical support for the Foundation Program may be muted by already high levels of program  participation  by  women.  Also  of  note,  Crittenden  and  Koons-Witt  found  gender differences in program availability as well ,  with women's prisons more likely to offer a higher level of programming,  which  adds  complexity  to  the  findings  regarding  higher  program participation by women.

As we consider the Foundation Program, we believe the BOP may want to explore implementing a gender-responsive version of this program for men. Implementing this type of pre-treatment, motivational  program  for  men  may  serve  to  significantly  increase  program  interest  and participation. The BOP has already developed a closely related program model for men, i.e., the Circle of Strength Program (see Chapter 7). This program appears to share similarities with the Foundation and Change Plan Programs, in that it aims to encourage participants to identify and address their programming needs.  At present, this program is offered primarily in detention centers.  The  BOP  might  implement  the  Circle  of  Strength  Program  more  broadly,  as  a  pretreatment, motivational program for newly designated men.  A wise plan might be to pilot this type of intervention using a randomized control trial design to evaluate its effectiveness.

Some of the nonresidential women's programs in this chapter lack outcome measures.  These programs could benefit from the addition of pre/post-test measures to determine if participants make substantive changes in their self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, and assertiveness skills.    For  example,  these  measures  might  include  psychological  inventories,  such  as  the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory, or a behavioral assessment of assertiveness skills.

As noted in other chapters of this report, the BOP should work to incorporate these programs more fully into policy.  At present, only two of the programs in this chapter are described in policy. Incorporating the remaining programs in policy will support the availability of these programs, as well as their quality.

## 13.8 Summary of Results

Three of the BOP's women's programs examined in this report are currently classified by the BOP as EBRR Programs. Based on our review of the evaluation research conducted on these programs published between 2000 and 2022, we find support for provisionally classifying the FIT Program as an EBRR Program, based on the classification of two program components as effective. We found promising support for the impact of women's programming aimed at psychosocial issues , but  only  one  of  the  BOP's  programs  in  this  ar ea  is  sufficiently  comparable  to  an  evaluated program. We find support for provisionally classifying the Assert Yourself for Female Offenders

Program  as  an  EBRR  Program,  although  we  do  have  concerns  about  the  low  dosage  of  this program.  We  cannot  support  classification  of  the  Foundation  Program  as  an  EBRR  Program, because it is not sufficiently comparable to evaluated programs in our review.

We were also asked to assess the remaining six programs, which are currently classified as PA Programs -the Change Plan, Understanding Your Feelings, Square One Essentials for Women, Women's Reflection Group, Women's Relationships I and II Programs. For these programs, our review  did  not  find  sufficient  research  to  make  any  determination  about  their  PA  Program designation. Once again, the necessary research with a correctional population has not been conducted.

The table below provides a summary of the results of our research review.

Study quality overall  was noted to be low. | 'The review highlighted a lack of evidence for  the efficacy of offense-specific interventions  facilitated with women and limited use of  recidivism as an outcome measure within the  literature, despite often being a key aim of the  interventions.' (291) The researchers noted '…there is less emphasis  in the literature on the use of offence-specific  interventions with women who offender and  greater emphasis on interventions directly  addressing the criminogenic needs of women  including trauma, mental health, and substance  misuse.' (314) The researchers also noted few programs were  developed specifically for women, thus testing  offense-specific interventions for women has  led to low quality studies due to lack of  comparisons with benchmarks or accepted  percentages.

| 1) Fernandez  et al. (2022) | Emotional Education  and Health Program  based on a model by  Mayer & Sluyter (1997)  A 16-session program  addressing the following  skills: social skills,  assertiveness, self- esteem, emotional  expression, feelings,  emotional intelligence,  emotional facilitation of  thought, relaxation,  problem resolution,  self-concept, self- esteem, emotional  regulation,  development of positive  thinking, facing  situations of anger,  resilience, emotional  understanding, and  emotional regulation. | 48 program participants  compared to a control  group of 48 non- participants.    To be eligible,  participants had to have a  prevalent pathology (e.g.,  chronic illness, mental  illness, substance use  disorder, infectious  disease).  They could not  be participating in other  programs at the time.  Outcome measures: Trait  Meta-Mood Scale,  Connor-Davidson  Resilience Scale,  Rosenberg Self-Esteem  Scale, Rathus  Assertiveness  Questionnaire, and Short  Form Health Survey. | 5 -  RCT longitudinal  study with pre/post- test repeated  measures with a  control group.    Limitations: Outcome  measures were not  validated on a prison  population. | Quality of life was noted to improve among program  participants as compared to the control group on  dimensions of self-esteem, resilience, assertiveness, and  emotional intelligence.    Implications of these results of a nursing intervention  program for the incarcerated population are significant  given the primary role nurses play in prison health care  and overall well-being.   'Nursing can and has the obligation of, caring for,  preventing, and treating the prisoners in a holistic manner,  including their emotional and physical health. Therefore,  socioemotional programs are of importance for the  comprehensive care of this populati on.' (114) 'The intragroup, preintervention and postintervention  comparisons in the study group showed improvements in  self-esteem (p = 0.00, r = 0.51), resilience (p = 0.00, r =  0.42), assertiveness (p = 0.00, r = 0.46), and emotional  intelligence in its dimensions of repair (p = 0.00, r = 0.32)  and clarity (p = 0.02, r = 0.22) as well as in most of the  quality of life dimensions. Significant intergroup  differences were also found in all of these variables,  except for attention and emotional clarity dimensions.'  (106) |

A  cohort of 1,685 female  FPI participants were  compared to a matched  group of 1,685 female  non-participants on  recidivism outcomes  (rearrest, return to  prison, time to arrest /  recommitment). | 3  -  Adequately  designed quasi- experiment with  propensity score  matching on key  demographic and  sentence and criminal  history background  characteristics. Only  individuals with at  least 1 year in FPI  were included in these  analyses, which  removes a significant  group of individuals  from the original  cohort. The non- participant group only  includes individuals  who were never in  FPI. No information  included about the  types of FPI programs  that women | This study only provides follow-up data on recidivism  outcomes. Rearrest rates 3 years post-release were 14.4%  for FPI participants of at least 1 year vs. 15.8% for non- participants; return to prison rate for FPI participants was  7.8% vs. 8.5% for non-participants. These differences were  not statistically significant. Separate analyses of the  potential impact of length of time in FPI employment on  recidivism did not reveal any significant impact of length of  employment on post-release recidivism. According to the  author. 'This suggests that a longer length of  employment…does not provide an added benefit in terms  of reducing the likelihood of recidivism upon release.'  (740). |

However, full  remission from PTSD occurred for only 12% to 23% of  participants. The reduction, on average, in CAPS PTSD  severity was comparable to that reported by Zlotnick and  colleagues (2009), i.e., approximately 12 to 13 points, but  only half the amount of improvement reported in studies  of TARGET as a one-to- one therapy for women and girls.'  (271)  'TARGET did not achieve greater improvement in affect  regulation than SGT. The small increase in Negative Mood  Regulation (NMR) scores achieved on average by TARGET  recipients suggest that the gains in affect regulation from  brief group therapy may not be sufficient to reverse the  trend of worsening affect dysregulation that has been  documented among incarcerated women over time.' (271) 'TARGET participants' increase in sense of forgiveness  (while SGT participants reported a decrease). This finding  suggests that a therapeutic focus on affect regulation may  provide a basis for incarcerated women with PTSD to  achieve a greater sense of emotional resolution in relation  to past victimization or betrayal.'

The program  'has a core goal of  preventing recidivism  and further violent  behavior by women  who have already  engaged in violence; it  also aims to improve  women's mental health  and anger expression  and reduce substance  use.' (663) Study setting was a  female-prison in a  midwestern state. | Randomized Control Trial:  'At the point of prison  treatment, a randomized  control trial was  designed, assigning  women to receive one of  two treatments in 1:1  ratio. Randomization  selection criteria for the  intervention study  included conviction of a  violent offense,  substance abuse  dependency or positive  drug screen during  incarceration, no serious  mental health issue that  specifically involved  housing on the mental  health unit, and eligibility  for release on parole  within 18 to 24 months.'  (664-5) | 4 : RCT design,  relatively small  sample size. '35  women were included  in the analysis, with  the independent  variable being  treatment condition  (TAU  n  =16; BV  n  =  19). Of the women  involved in this study,  there were no  differences in  measures of mental  health (i.e.,  depression, anxiety,  PTSD) at pretest.

treatment program for persons with BPD that combines cognitive-behavioral elements with skills training but does not include individual therapy. The program consists of 20 2-hour weekly sessions with facilitators who follow detailed lesson plans. The program involves psychoeducation about BPD, emotionmanagement skills training, and behaviormanagement skills training. The first component teaches subjects to replace misconceptions about BPD with an awareness of the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that define it, and to identify their own schemas (i.e., cognitive filters) that drive their behaviors. The second component teaches skills to better manage the cognitive and emotional effects of BPD: distancing, improvement across a spectrum of illness-specific measures, in their negative affectivity, and in their mood. These results are encouraging because they suggest that a relatively brief adjunctive program for BPD can deliver "real world" benefit to offenders and improve quality of life. The effect sizes reported herein are simi lar in magnitude to those reported in our RCT. 28  This project also shows that STEPPS can be successfully implemented in a prison setting without modifying the existing manual, and that incarceration is not a barrier to improvement. The STEPPS program helped subjects to better understand their BPD and taught them new skills to better manage their disorder. Of course, the program may have provided social support, hope and therapeutic alliance, factors common to most forms of therapy. The results also suggest that the women were less likely to feel hopeless and helpless or to have negative self-impressions. These changes reflect the emphasis of the program on instructing subjects to self-regulate their intense emotions and maladaptive behaviors. The women also had high levels of satisfaction with the program.' (885)

The authors state 'women in the prison system benefitted from both the therapeutic community treatment program and the cognitive behavioral intervention, with the trajectory of gains differing within specific domains over short- and long-term follow-up. The therapeutic community provided a comprehensive model of substance abuse treatment that integrated gender-specific approaches and practices (e.g., positive coping strategies for distress) that, given the strong evidence of cooccurring mental health and trauma needs of incarcerated women, appears to be more effective than the standard correctional cognitive-behavioral substance abuse treatment at improving reincarceration rates, lengthening time in the community before reincarceration and therapeutic community program with those in a intervention.

See also  Chapter 10,  Faith-Based  Programs | Faith- and Character- Based Institutions (FCBI)  for men and women of  varying security levels  and different faith  groups.  Participants volunteer  for FCBI placement and  may be of any religious  faith or none at all. To  be accepted into the  program, the individual  cannot have received a  disciplinary report  resulting in confinement  in the previous 90 days.  To remain in the FCBI,  individuals must  participate in at least  one program per week.  Programming is  provided by numerous  community volunteers,  under the guidance of  the institution's  chaplaincy staff. A wide  range of programming is  included: worship | A process and outcome  evaluation of the FCBI in  two facilities.  This  summary focuses on the  outcome study, which  addressed recidivism  rates within 26 months of  release.  696 males and 261  females incarcerated on  9/30/04 at two FCBIs  were analyzed and  compared to individuals  in all other Florida prisons  on that date (n=74,006  males and 4,802  females).  Significant differences  between the criminal  backgrounds of the male  groups were noted, e.g.,  less violent criminal  history, but these  differences were not  found in the female  groups on this variable. | 3 -  Quasi- experimental design  with matched  controls.  Individuals housed at  an FCBI on 9/30/04,  and released between  2004-2005, and  housed in an FCBI for  at least 3 months  were matched to  similar inmates who  were not housed in an  FCBI using a one-to- one categorical exact  matching technique.  Matching factors  included: gender, age,  race, primary offense  type, violent or  nonviolent offense,  number of prior  incarcerations, time  served, and  disciplinary report  rate.  Limitations: less  tangible group | 'For both males and females, no statistically significant  difference was found in the proportion of FCBI and non- FCBI inmates returned to prison within 12, 18, 24, and 26  months of release.' (245) 'There was also no statistically significant difference  between the treatment and comparison groups in the  proportion of inmates who were reincarcerated for a  technical violation (i.e., a parole or probation violation)  versus a new crime.' (245) 'Because the sample sizes are relatively small, however,  the possibility of a small or moderate effect on recidivism  cannot be ruled out. Yet it should be noted that for  females, the effect, while not statistically significant, was  in the opposite direction from what was expected: a  greater proportion of female FCBI inmates were  reincarcerated at 18, 24, and 26 months than the inmates  from the comparison group.' (245) Of note: 'Because of this variation in program activity at  the facility and individual levels, participation in an FCBI  cannot be treated as a fixed experience that is identical for  all inmates.

'Participant -initiated pre-cessation smoking reduction may  be initially helpful in preparing to quit smoking, or may  serve as a marker for participant motivation to quit  smoking, but these differences do not sustain over time.  More intensive interventions are still needed for successful  cessation.' (73) 'Our study showed that smokers who reduced prior to  their quit attempt showed better cessation rates during  initial post-quit weeks of the smoking cessation program  than did those who did not reduce.

For the  BSI, participants scored significantly lower on the posttest  than the pretest (p = .001), which was in the expected  direction indicating a decrease in psychological distress.
