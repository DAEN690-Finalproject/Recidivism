did show an improvement in the cognitive dimension of
the Coping Resources Inventory. Participants were more
likely to use coping resources to handle stress than prior to

participant group did not.
The authors report issues with program implementation
that may have negatively impacted both treatment
provision and measured outcomes. Limitations with both
design and program delivery illustrate the difficulties of
