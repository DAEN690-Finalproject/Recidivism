therapy. The program
consists of 20 two-
hour weekly sessions
with therapists who
follow detailed lesson
plans. (We generally
recommend having
two co-therapists.)
Key elements include
psychoeducation
about BPD, emotion
management skills
training, and behavior
management skills
training. A systems
component is unique
to the program. For
the prison setting, this
involved one-time 2-
hour evening sessions
for system members.
In addition to family
members and friends,
corrections officers
and other staff
members are in
attendance. These
individuals are
educated about BPD
and how best to
respond to their
relative or friend or an
offender with the
disorder.” (125-6)","Thus, the benefit of STEPPS seems to extend beyond
subjective experience, and the program may help correct
an individual’s behavior. The magnitude of change is
consistent with what has been reported for STEPPS
programs conducted in the community in the United
States, United Kingdom, and Holland.” (127)
“The data show that STEPPS can be successfully
transported to the correctional setting ‘‘as is’’ and without
modification.” (128)"
