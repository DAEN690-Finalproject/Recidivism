Solving (Taymans &
Parese, 1998) are
compared across small
diversion and prison
samples for men and
women. A second
program, Pathfinders
(Hansen, 1993), was
compared to the
Problem Solving
program among
incarcerated women
offenders to determine
whether its focus upon
empowerment and
relationships enhanced
the effects of the more
generic program.” (69)
Setting was a
southeastern U.S. state.","The quasi-experimental
design of the study
“allowed for the
comparison of treatment
effects for men and
women in both
community (diversion)
and prison settings.” (76)
661 total subjects
participated in the study
across 4 contexts. Each
context had at least one
experimental group and a
comparison group.","3 - Experimental
groups with
comparison groups
lacking random
assignment. For some
of the contexts (e.g.,
men’s prison), sample
sizes were smaller
than optimal,
therefore “results are
not as definitive as
they might have been
with larger samples.”
(89)","“The Problem Solving program did not impact
interpersonal conflicts and problems related to work
assignments, the program significantly reduced reported
misconducts for men and women in diversion and women
in prison settings. Problem Solving participants also
achieved significantly lower depression scores relative to
comparison group members in the two diversion settings
and in the men's prison. In the women's prison group,
Pathfinders significantly reduced depression scores over a
longer, sustained, period of time, whereas the Problem
Solving program had no impact.” (87-8)"

disciplinary reports in the post program period with a
greater number of sessions attended. A 5% decrease in the
incident rate of disciplinary reports was found for every
