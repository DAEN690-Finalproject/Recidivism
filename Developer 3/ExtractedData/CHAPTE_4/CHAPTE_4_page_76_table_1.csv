follow-up, mothers showed significant improvements over
their pretest scores in parenting attitudes, self-esteem,
and legal knowledge regarding parental rights and
responsibilities. Mothers' open-ended comments showed
they gained an understanding that children need love,
letters, and consistency and that they should show the
caregivers respect, gratitude, and support. There was no
change in frequency of letters written home, however,
despite much emphasis on letter-writing during the
