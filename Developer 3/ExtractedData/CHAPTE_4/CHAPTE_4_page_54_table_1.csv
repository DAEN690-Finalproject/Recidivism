"for Mental/
Behavioral
Disorders","treatment as usual
(TAU) on incarcerated
females with
psychological distress.
Study setting was a
female institution in
Hong Kong.","study. They had no
specific treatments other
than
CBT or PPI. Another 35
female offenders on the
waiting list were
recruited as comparison
women. Given the limited
capacity of the facility, it
was not feasible to
accommodate both
treatment participants
and comparison
participants on the same
unit, so the comparison
women continued to
reside elsewhere in
the prison. All women
otherwise received TAU,
which included officers
and clinical psychologists
providing supportive
counselling to them 2–4
times per
month, according to
usual practice when
women are on the PSY
GYM waiting list. None of
the comparison women
received any CBT or PPI.”
(161)","one, the women first
received eight
sessions of CBT,
followed by eight
sessions of PPI, and in
the other they first
received eight
sessions of PPI,
followed by eight
sessions of CBT. A
battery of self-report
measures was
distributed to the
participants
before session 1 (Time
1), after session 8
(Time 2) and after
session 16 (Time
3). Comparison
between the two
groups at each Time
point allowed
evaluation of
effectiveness of the
interventions
compared with TAU.
Comparison
between measures at
Time 1 and Time 2 in
the treatment group
only allowed
evaluation of the
relative effectiveness
of CBT and PPI.
Comparison between
Time 2 and Time 3 in
the treatment group
allowed us to test for","psychological well-being but also to reduce psychological
distress significantly. A longer course of treatment in
which women received both forms of intervention had
advantages over either separately.” (167-8)"
