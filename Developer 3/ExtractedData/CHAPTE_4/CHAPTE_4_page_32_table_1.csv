To be eligible,

Limitations: Outcome

participants as compared to the control group on
dimensions of self-esteem, resilience, assertiveness, and
emotional intelligence.
Implications of these results of a nursing intervention
program for the incarcerated population are significant
given the primary role nurses play in prison health care
and overall well-being.
“Nursing can and has the obligation of, caring for,
preventing, and treating the prisoners in a holistic manner,
including their emotional and physical health. Therefore,
socioemotional programs are of importance for the
comprehensive care of this population.” (114)
“The intragroup, preintervention and postintervention
comparisons in the study group showed improvements in
self-esteem (p = 0.00, r = 0.51), resilience (p = 0.00, r =
0.42), assertiveness (p = 0.00, r = 0.46), and emotional
intelligence in its dimensions of repair (p = 0.00, r = 0.32)
and clarity (p = 0.02, r = 0.22) as well as in most of the
quality of life dimensions. Significant intergroup
differences were also found in all of these variables,
except for attention and emotional clarity dimensions.”
