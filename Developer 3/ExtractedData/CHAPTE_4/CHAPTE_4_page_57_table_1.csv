improvements noted at 3-month follow-up in PTSD and

“Overall, our data suggest that Seeking Safety treatment
appears to be appealing to incarcerated women with SUD
and PTSD and that the treatment has the potential to be
beneficial, especially for improving PTSD symptoms.
However, these findings are tentative given that there was
no control group.” (99)"
