Univariate models and individual t tests indicated that
males reported a significant increase in individual
empowerment, while females did not report change from
pre- to posttest.” (84)
Certain measured outcomes of relationship education
programming that approached but did not achieve
significance may have been attenuated by post-test
attrition, and thus final sample size, as the trend was for
change in the desired direction on these dimensions."
