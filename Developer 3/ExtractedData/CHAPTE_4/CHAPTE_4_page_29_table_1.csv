Moderate effect sizes noted.
Authors reported that “overall, our systematic
review showed that women who participate in
correctional-based interventions tend to
improve their psychological well-being as
compared to women who did not participate in
such programs.” (25)
In terms of recidivism reduction, they found
that “the three studies with the largest
demonstrated reduction in recidivism were
evaluations of prison-wide therapeutic
community programs designed to reduce
substance abuse.” (27)
While substance abuse programs in both the
enhancement and risk reduction studies
showed particular promise, those initiatives
seeking other outcomes (such as HIV-infection
prevention and parenting skills) were not as
successful.",,
