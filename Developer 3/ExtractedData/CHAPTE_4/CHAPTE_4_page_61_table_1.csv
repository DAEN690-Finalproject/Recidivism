Both treatment groups showed improvement in various
psycho-social indicators at post-release follow-up points.
Researchers presented 3-month and 6-month follow-up
data on drug use: “With regard to abstinence, the
percentage of abstinent women in ACT condition was
higher than CBT and CG conditions at all times. Although it
is true that all the groups increased their percentages of
abstinence over time, the CBT and CG groups had a similar
evolution.” (651)"
