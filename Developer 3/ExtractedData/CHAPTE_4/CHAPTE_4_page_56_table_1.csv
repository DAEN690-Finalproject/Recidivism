incarcerated individuals.
The study involved
individuals incarcerated
in Connecticut’s
Department of
Corrections","infractions were placed
on participation beyond
exclusion of inmates in
segregation. Initially, the
data contained 1,112
records. After data
cleaning, there were 946
participation events,
representing 846 unique
inmates.” (38)",,"to members of the groups with higher security risk. All
diagnostic groups appeared to benefit from greater
participation, although some groups more than others. In
particular, inmates with anxiety, personality, and psychotic
disorders had the steepest downward predicted number
of disciplinary reports with more sessions attended.” (41)"

assigned to Seeking

completed the program,

than two unexcused
absences (absences were
excused for medical,

limitations of this
study were noted by
authors, including lack
of a control group,
high drop-out rate
(33%), no measures of
substance use, and no
post-program follow-
up data. (708)","“Clinical results of this open trial offer support for the
effective treatment of PTSD among female inmates with
PTSD, SUD, and other serious mental illnesses. Treatment
completers showed significant improvements from pre- to
post-treatment on overall PTSD symptoms and global
severity of illness, with medium effect sizes for both
domains. On average, for the full sample of completers
scores decreased by 8.5 points, a 22% reduction from the
baseline average.” (708)"
