(Oregon DOC)","359 incarcerated subjects
- 198 mothers and 161
fathers. 182 parents in
the program and 177
parents receiving services
as usual.
Using the same
sample/intervention as
described in Eddy et al.
(2013), researchers
examined the potential
influence of a
theoretically based
moderator - living with
children before
incarceration.","5 - RCT, with pre/post-
test design, to include
a 6- and 12-month
post release follow-
up.
Randomization to
condition was at the
individual level,
blocking on sex and on
race and ethnicity.","Results support the efficacy of the PIO program for
reducing recidivism as defined as well as the positive
effects shown on parent-child attachment and family
social support.
“Participants in the PIO condition who lived with their
child before incarceration had 52.2% fewer arrests than
participants in the control condition who did not live with
their child before incarceration and, although not
significant, 23.7% fewer arrests than participants in the
control group who lived with their child before
incarceration. Similarly, participants in the PIO condition
who did not live with their child before incarceration had
53.6% fewer arrests than participants in the control
condition who did not live with their child before
incarceration and, again, although not significant, 26.3%
fewer arrests than the control group who lived with their
child before incarceration. There were virtually no
differences in postrelease arrests between participants in
the PIO condition who lived with their child before
incarceration and participants in the PIO condition who did
not live with their child previously.” (106)"

ratings, inmate gender and age, and total family contacts
in prison, participants assigned to the intervention
condition reported significantly less stress than control
participants at the post-intervention assessment (b 1⁄4
