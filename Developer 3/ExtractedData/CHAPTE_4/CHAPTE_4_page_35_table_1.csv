“CTC improved well-being according to the MWA and the
D-HS. CTC resulted in improved emotional-experiential
well-being, t(57) = −5.12, p < .001; d = −.68, greater
pro-social behavior, t(57) = −4.23, p < .001; d = −.56, and

t(57) = −7.37, p < .001; d = −1.00 (H1). Change on the D-HS
among Phase 1 participants was significantly greater than
that of Phase 4 participants, t(94) = 4.12, p < .001; d = .88.
The Phase 4 cohort reported greater emotional-
experiential well-being, t(95) = 2.86, p = .005, d = −.59, and
lower depression, t(95) = −4.21, p < .001, d = −.87, at
baseline (H2), demonstrating lasting effects of prolonged
engagement with CTC (H2).” (765)
“In addition, the authors were unable to formally assess
recidivism rates specifically for the women in this
evaluation. However, since the inception of CTC program
at the
prison, all women who received any CTC training and were
subsequently released (n = 175) were tracked post-release
over a 2-year period. These data revealed that only 2.9%
recidivated post-release, compared with the general
recidivism rate for women in the state of 57% (SOMS,
2011).” (767)"
