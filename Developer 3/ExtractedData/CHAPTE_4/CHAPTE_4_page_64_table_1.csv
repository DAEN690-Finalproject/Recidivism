Programs",,"Faith- and Character-
Based Institutions (FCBI)
for men and women of
varying security levels
and different faith
groups.
Participants volunteer
for FCBI placement and
may be of any religious
faith or none at all. To
be accepted into the
program, the individual
cannot have received a
disciplinary report
resulting in confinement
in the previous 90 days.
To remain in the FCBI,
individuals must
participate in at least
one program per week.
Programming is
provided by numerous
community volunteers,
under the guidance of
the institution’s
chaplaincy staff. A wide
range of programming is
included: worship","A process and outcome
evaluation of the FCBI in
two facilities. This
summary focuses on the
outcome study, which
addressed recidivism
rates within 26 months of
release.
696 males and 261
females incarcerated on
9/30/04 at two FCBIs
were analyzed and
compared to individuals
in all other Florida prisons
on that date (n=74,006
males and 4,802
females).
Significant differences
between the criminal
backgrounds of the male
groups were noted, e.g.,
less violent criminal
history, but these
differences were not
found in the female
groups on this variable.","3 - Quasi-
experimental design
with matched
controls.
Individuals housed at
an FCBI on 9/30/04,
and released between
2004-2005, and
housed in an FCBI for
at least 3 months
were matched to
similar inmates who
were not housed in an
FCBI using a one-to-
one categorical exact
matching technique.
Matching factors
included: gender, age,
race, primary offense
type, violent or
nonviolent offense,
number of prior
incarcerations, time
served, and
disciplinary report
rate.
Limitations: less
tangible group","“For both males and females, no statistically significant
difference was found in the proportion of FCBI and non-
FCBI inmates returned to prison within 12, 18, 24, and 26
months of release.” (245)
“There was also no statistically significant difference
between the treatment and comparison groups in the
proportion of inmates who were reincarcerated for a
technical violation (i.e., a parole or probation violation)
versus a new crime.” (245)
“Because the sample sizes are relatively small, however,
the possibility of a small or moderate effect on recidivism
cannot be ruled out. Yet it should be noted that for
females, the effect, while not statistically significant, was
in the opposite direction from what was expected: a
greater proportion of female FCBI inmates were
reincarcerated at 18, 24, and 26 months than the inmates
from the comparison group.” (245)
Of note: “Because of this variation in program activity at
the facility and individual levels, participation in an FCBI
cannot be treated as a fixed experience that is identical for
all inmates. The lack of standardized programming should
be kept in mind when considering measurements of
program effectiveness and opportunities for replicating
the FCBI model elsewhere.” (240-241)"
