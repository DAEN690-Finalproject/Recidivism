This study “investigated
the efficacy of a pure
psychoeducational
intervention for
complex trauma. A brief

was delivered to n = 44
female prisoners in a
compressed format to
accommodate short
sentence lengths and
was compared with
usual care (n = 42).”

“The study design utilized
a control WL/TAU
comparator group.
Existing
psychotherapeutic and

treatments (i.e., ‘usual

standardized intervention
for interpersonal trauma.
S&T is a manualized
psychoeducational
intervention of 8–10
sessions. Each session
focused on a separate
symptom or rehabilitative
concern often attributed
to the distress caused by
interpersonal trauma.”

the majority of measures in the analyses. Small, non-
statistically significant symptom increases for the S&T
group were evident for behavioral stability. The behavioral
stability total score indicated that the symptom increase
was predominantly observed between T1 (M = 69.94, SD =
23.72) and T2 (M = 73.18, SD = 19.84). There were
however no statistically significant differences between

“As an intervention designed to ameliorate PTSD
symptoms, S&T did not produce statistically or clinically
significant levels of change compared with a WL/TAU
control group. As a psychoeducational intervention, S&T's
limited impact on trauma symptomatology was expected.
However, as an intervention designed to stabilize
symptoms, there are concerns about how effective this
intervention might be in a prison setting.” (606)"
