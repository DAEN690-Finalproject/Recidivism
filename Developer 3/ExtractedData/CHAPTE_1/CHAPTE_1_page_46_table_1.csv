Researchers “developed and

intervention with recently
incarcerated women who
volunteered to participate. It
was hypothesized that this brief
group intervention would
reduce trauma-related
symptomatology when
compared to a wait-list control
group. Two trauma-specific and
one general measure were
administered pre and post
treatment. A randomly selected
wait-list control group was
given the same measures, and
then also offered the
treatments after the initial
treatment group went through
post-tests.” (105)","2 - Weak research design –
