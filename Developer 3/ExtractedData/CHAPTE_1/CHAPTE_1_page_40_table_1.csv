differences) and the effect size was small. When
treatment was disaggregated by intervention type, the
effect of M-TREM on PTSD severity was double that

mental health symptoms, self-esteem, and proactive
coping.” (78)"

(Australia Prison)","Randomized Control Trial (RCT):
A randomized controlled trial
was conducted in which male
prisoners were allocated to
receive either SS plus
treatment-as-usual (TAU) or
TAU alone. Randomization was
stratified by correctional center
and was performed face-to-face
via an envelope selection task
and occurred prior to the
baseline assessment (1:1).
“Fifteen participants were","4 - RCT design, with one
experimental group that
received SS plus TAU, and
one group receiving TAU
alone. Relatively small sample
size (15 participants in each
group).","“The SS group increased confidence ratings in their
ability to resist substance use in future situations, with
an increase from 70% at baseline to 91% at six-month
follow-up. The confidence rating for the TAU group, on
the other hand, remained relatively stable over time
(76% at baseline and 79% at six-month follow-up.)” (50)
“Both study groups appear to show reductions in PTSD
diagnosis and PTSD symptom severity at eight-week and
six-month follow-ups. Similarly, evidence indicates that
both groups evidenced reductions in PTSD-related
cognitions over the study period.” (50)"
