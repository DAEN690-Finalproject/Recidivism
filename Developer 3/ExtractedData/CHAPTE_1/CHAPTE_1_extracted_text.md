## TRAUMA PROGRAMS

In this chapter, we review prison-based trauma programs, i.e., programs designed to address the impact of traumatic life events. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) offers eight First Step Act (FSA) approved programs in this category.  This category includes five Psychology Services Branch (PSB)  programs,  with  four  programs  classified  by  the  BOP  as  Evidence-Based  Recidivism Reduction (EBRR) Programs and one program classified as a Productive Activity (PA) Program. This category also includes three Women and Special Populations Branch (WSPB) programs, all of which are classified by the BOP as PA Programs.  We begin by describing the BOP's trauma programs, to include the assessment of needs addressed by the programs. We then describe our study identification procedures, provide a review of evaluations conducted in other jurisdictions, and offer an assessment of the effectiveness of each BOP trauma program based on our review. We  then  conclude  this  chapter  with  recommendations  for  future  trauma  programming initiatives.

## 6.1 Overview of Trauma Needs and Programs

The BOP offers a series of programs for incarcerated persons who have experience traumatic life events. Many of these programs rely on cognitive-behavioral interventions to address treatment needs. All these trauma programs are supported by the Reentry Services Division (RSD), five by the PSB and three by the WSPB. The PSB programs are staffed primarily by doctoral level clinical and counseling psychologists. The dedicated staffing complement for each program will be noted in the program descriptions found below. WSPB programs may be facilitated by a variety of staff, contractors, and/or volunteers. Recommended program facilitators will be noted in the program descriptions found below.

As noted in Chapter 5, all psychologists are required to complete New Psychologists Training, a 24hour training offered at the BOP's training facility in Aurora, Colorado. In addition, specialized mental health training is provided to staff working in programs for individuals with mental and/or behavioral  disorders.  Web-based  training  in  cognitive-behavioral  interventions  is  also  made available  to  applicable  staff.  In  addition,  the  BOP  offers  a  series  of  continuing  education opportunities  throughout  the  year,  in  support  of  staff  maintaining  their  expertise  and professional licensure.  Specialized training for individuals facilitating the Women and Special Populations Branch programs is not indicated.

Programs for  incarcerated  individuals  who  have  experienced  traumatic  life  events  address  a series of needs. In addition to addressing trauma needs, most of these programs directly address mental health needs. Trauma needs are also addressed in programs for incarcerated individuals with  serious  mental  illnesses,  but  they  are  addressed  more  directly  in  the  trauma  programs described in this chapter. Of note, one of the programs addressed in this chapter - the Beyond Violence Program - is not characterized by the BOP as addressing a trauma need; however, the program developer characterizes the program as a trauma treatment intervention, so we have included the program in this chapter.

The procedures for identifying mental health needs are described in Chapter 5 of this report. Trauma programs may also focus on closely related needs, i.e., cognitions and anger/hostility, and  some  trauma  programs  also  address  ancillary  needs  to  provide  a  more  comprehensive treatment experience, e.g., education or work needs. Procedures for identifying trauma needs are described below. Procedures for identifying education and work needs were described in Chapters  2  and  4  respectively,  and  procedures  for  identifying  cognitions  and  anger/hostility needs will be described in Chapter 7 of this report.

## 6.1.1 Identifying Trauma Needs

Program  Statement  5400.01  First  Step  Act  Needs  Assessment indicates  Psychology  Services departments are responsible for assessing trauma needs during the initial intake screening (RSD, 2021). This policy refers staff to the BOP's internal website, Sallyport, for additional information. According to the BOP, trauma  needs refer to adverse childhood experiences associated with significant increases in negative social, behavioral health, and physical outcomes (BOP, 2022). The  BOP  has  adopted  the  Adverse  Childhood  Experiences  Scale  (ACES)  to  screen for  trauma needs.  Developed  by  Felitti  et  al.  (1998),  the  10-item  ACES  measures  childhood  exposure  to trauma, including physical, verbal, and sexual abuse; physical and emotional neglect; exposure to  a  family  member with a substance use disorder, mental illness, domestic violence, and/or incarceration; and divorce, death, and/or abandonment by a parent.

While  Psychology  Services  is  described  as  the  department  responsible  for  assessing  trauma needs, it is important to note the ACES is a self-report instrument. Incarcerated individuals are to complete the ACES via the BOP's internal computer system. Per the BOP, 'Inmates are advised of the assessments at Admission and Orientation and are reminded of the assessments at intake with Psychology Services. Additionally, the inmate computer system has a bulletin that details the availability of the assessments' (BO P, 2022). Historically, this approach to needs assessments has resulted in reduced completion rates. Per the BOP's most recent needs assessment report, 23% of incarcerated individuals refused to complete the ACES (BOP, 2022). The newly issued Program  Statement  5410.01,  CN-2,  First  Step  Act  of  2018 -Time  Credits:  Procedures  for

Implementation  of  18  U.S.C.  3632(d)(4) establishes  an  additional  incentive  for  individuals  to complete self-report needs assessments (CPB, 2023). Specifically, individuals will be unable to earn time credits until these assessments are complete. This new requirement will likely increase the number of individuals who complete these assessments. For individuals who do complete the ACES, 46% present with trauma needs (BOP, 2022).  The ACES cutoff score used to make this determination is not clearly noted in publicly available documents. A more refined assessment of  trauma  needs  is  conducted  within  the  Resolve  Program,  once  an  individual  completes preliminary trauma treatment programming, which will be discussed in a subsequent section of this report.

## 6.2 Trauma Program Descriptions

The BOP offers five PSB programs focusing on the treatment of trauma-related mental disorders - the Resolve, Trauma Education, Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength, Cognitive Processing Therapy, and Dialectical Behavior Therapy Programs. In addition, the BOP offers three trauma programs specifically for women - the Advancing Career Counseling and Employment Support for Survivors (ACCESS) Program, Beyond Violence: Prevention Program for Criminal Justice Involved Women, and Pu'a Foundation Reentry Program - all of which are supported by the WSPB.  All but one of these eight programs is noted to address a trauma need, as well as other relevant needs. General procedures for identifying trauma-related needs were described in the previous section of this report. Additional needs assessment procedures are incorporated into the BO P's programs for individuals  with  trauma-related  disorders,  and  these  procedures  are  described  below  in  the context of each relevant program.

The below table outlines key features of the BOP's eight trauma programs, including the target population, needs addressed, and program dosage. In addition, the table notes the number of institutions offering the program and the number of individuals participating in the program at the  close  of  FY  2023.  Lastly,  the  table  provides  an  estimate  of  the  percentage  of  the  target population served by the program to date. Specifically, this estimate compares the total number of program participants and graduates in custody to the total number of individuals in custody with a potential need for such a program. This estimate represents an educated guess, as we did not have access to data allowing for perfect one-to-one comparisons of needs and programs. Following the table, each trauma program is described in detail.

## Psychology Services Branch Trauma Programs

Five of the BOP's trauma programs are supported by the PSB, and are made available to both men and women, with gender-responsive modifications. Four of the programs are classified by the BOP as EBRR Programs - the Resolve, Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength, Cognitive Processing Therapy, and Dialectical Behavior Therapy Programs. One program is classified by the BOP as a

PA Program - the Trauma Education Program. These programs, to include gender-responsive elements, are described below.

## 6.2.1 Resolve Program

The Resolve Program was originally implemented in the agency as a comprehensive treatment protocol to address the trauma treatment needs of  women.  The program was subsequently expanded  to  serve  males  as  well,  with  gender-specific  revisions.  In  addition,  the  program components were adopted for use as stand-alone programs in institutions without a Resolve Program.

The Resolve Program is the BOP's foundational trauma treatment program. The Resolve Program is  explicitly  described  in Program  Statement  5330.11  Psychology  Treatment  Programs (PSB, 2016).  Resolve  Program  institutions  have  a  doctoral  level  psychologist,  a  Resolve  Program Coordinator, dedicated to the provision of trauma treatment services. The program consists of a series  of  interventions,  i.e.,  programs,  for  individuals  with  trauma-related  treatment  needs. Program components are delivered based on individual treatment needs, considering both an individual 's diagnosis and level of functioning. Resolve Program interventions may be delivered separately as stand-alone programs at non-Resolve Program institutions.

The  Resolve  Program  is designed  to  'address  the  trauma -related  mental  health  needs  of individuals' (BOP, 2022). The program integrates multiple component programs into a single model: (1) an initial psychoeducational workshop, the Trauma Education Program; (2) a skillsbased  treatment  group,  the  Seeking  Safety/Seeking  Strength  Program;  (3)  more  intensive treatments in the form of the Cognitive Processing Therapy Program or the Dialectical Behavior Therapy Program; and (4) a maintenance skills group for individuals who remain interested in treatment,  but  whose  symptoms,  if  present,  no  longer  interfere  with  daily  functioning.  The program was originally implemented in the agency in 2007 as the BOP's standardized approach to  trauma  treatment  for  incarcerated  women.  The  program  was  later  expanded  to  serve incarcerated mens as well, with gender-responsive revisions to elements of the program. The stated  goal  of  the  program  is  to  'decrease  the  incidence  of  trauma -related  psychological disorders and improve level of functioning' (BOP, 2022). The target population for this pro gram is individuals with a history of trauma. In addition to trauma needs, the program also addresses cognitions and mental health needs. Referral procedures for specific components of the program are noted below.

Up  to  90  hours  are  required  for  completion  of  the  full  Resolve  Program,  which  is  delivered primarily  in a group  setting.  Program  activities  include  psychoeducational  interventions, interactive groups and journaling, homework assignments, and skills practice. Individuals begin

the  program  with  the  psychoeducational  workshop,  Trauma  in  Life  for  women  or  Resilience Support  for  men.  Before  progressing  beyond  the  psychoeducational  intervention,  individuals complete  a  psychosocial  assessment  interview,  which  includes  a  review  of  their  completed Trauma Education journal. As a prerequisite for participation in other components of the Resolve Program, individuals must have a trauma-related mental disorder and a treatment plan must be developed  to  address  this  disorder.  The  Resolve  Program  Coordinator  is  responsible  for conducting  the  assessment  interview,  providing  a  diagnosis  (if  applicable),  and  developing  a treatment  plan.  In  policy,  suggested  diagnostic  tools  include  the  Stressful  Life  Experiences Screening (SLES), a supplemental questionnaire to identify additional traumatic life experiences, and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) (PSB, 2016).  Sallyport offers additional guidance on appropriate diagnostic tools (see below).

Per policy, individuals with an identified trauma-related mental disorder are then admitted to the  Seeking  Safety/Seeking  Strength  program  component.  Individuals  who  complete  this program component and continue to present with a trauma-related mental disorder are then referred to the Cognitive Processing Therapy program component if they are suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder, a depressive disorder, or anxiety disorder and/or to the Dialectical Behavior Therapy program component if they are suffering from a trauma-related personality disorder (PSB , 2016). The BOP's internal website suggests a slightly different organization for the program,  with  individuals  referred  to  Seeking  Safety/Seeking  Strength  and/or  Dialectical Behavior Therapy following Trauma Education, then referred to Cognitive Processing Therapy if they remain symptomatic after these skills-based interventions (PSB, n.d.).  While individuals are participating in these program components, they receive progress reviews every 60 days and updates to their treatment plans as appropriate. When individuals complete these phases of the program, they may be enrolled in an ongoing  maintenance skills group.  This group utilizes a supportive and educational orientation to maintain treatment gains. The open-ended, continuous group typically meets monthly for 60-90 minutes (PSB, 2016). Of note, this element of the Resolve Program is not offered as a stand-alone program. It is available only in the context of the Resolve Program.

When program components are delivered in the context of a Resolve Program, there are Program Review Guidelines in place to support program fidelity. As noted below, there are also fidelity checklists for each individual program component, although their use is not mandated in policy. In  addition  to  reducing  the  symptoms  of  trauma-related mental disorders, developing coping skills,  and  improving  institutional  adjustment,  the  program's  anticipated  outcomes  include  a reduction in recidivism. Program outcomes for the Resolve Program are not formally measured, but intermediate outcome measures might include mental health care levels, incident reports, and further program participation.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Resolve Program is described as available at 31 institutions; however, at the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 26 institutions (BOP, 2023).  In calendar year 2021, 493 individuals were enrolled in the program and 52 individuals completed  the  program  (BJS,  2022).    At  the  close  of  FY  2023,  there  were  692  individuals participating in the program, up from 629 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 2.89% of the BOP population with a trauma need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

Descriptions of each of the component programs of the Resolve Program are provided below. At non-Resolve Program institutions, a Psychology Services staff member, typically a doctoral level psychologist, can facilitate these components as stand-alone progr ams, i.e., 'Priority Practices' referenced in Program Statement 5310.16 Treatment and Care of Inmates with Mental Illness (PSB, 2016).

## 6.2.2 Trauma Education Program

The Trauma Education Program is designed to facilitate understanding of traumatic experiences and  their  impact  (BOP,  2022).  The  program  is  both  a  stand-alone  program  and  the  first component of the Resolve Program. This  psychoeducational  program  is  gender-specific,  with gender-responsive interactive journals -Trauma in Life for females and Stress and Resilience for males. The stated goal of the program is to enhance individuals' understanding of traumatic life events and their impact. The program is also designed to encourage participation in additional treatment, to include the Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength, Cognitive Processing Therapy, and Dialectical Behavior Therapy Programs. The target population for this program is individuals with a trauma need, as well as a mental health need. The Trauma Education Program is noted to be designed for individuals who meet any of the following three criteria: (1) evidence the individual has  a  history  of  traumatic  life  events,  (2)  evidence  that  the  individual  suffers  from  a  mental disorder potentially associated with a traumatic life event, and/or (3) the individual expresses an interest in learning more about trauma and its potential impact; e.g., an individual who physically abused her children wants to learn more about the potential impact of her actions (PSB, 2016). Individuals are referred to the program based on their ACES score, presentation with a traumarelated mental disorder, and/or an expressed interest in the impact of trauma.

The Trauma Education Program is a psychoeducational course consisting of 4 2-hour sessions with a combination of instruction, group discussions, and interactive journaling. The program does  not  include  explicit  discussion  of  personal  traumas.  Instead,  the  program  focuses  on understanding  traumatic  experiences  and  their  impact,  building  resilience,  and  encouraging participation in further treatment as applicable. Because the program is intended to motivate

individuals  to  volunteer  for  additional  treatment,  the  program  is  typically  provided  at  the beginning of the individual 's sentence, ordinarily within 12 months of their initial designation.

Resources  for  the  program  include  facilitator  guides  and  participant  manuals,  developed  in collaboration with the Change Companies (The Change Companies, n.d.). Per the BOP's internal website, Sallyport, at the end of the Trauma Education Program, all participants are administered the following assessment instruments: Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) Scale, Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), and the PTSD Checklist for Civilians (PCL-5) (BOP, n.d.). Based on the results of these assessments, p articipants' trauma need will be noted as fully addressed or they will be referred to the Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength Program. The BOP's internal website provides specific guidance as to how to proceed based on scores on these assessments.  If an individual obtains a score of 30 or lower on the PCL-4, 4 or lower on GAD-7, and 13 or lower on BDI II, the individual's trauma need will be considered fully addressed. If an individual obtains a score 30 or less on PCL-5 and a score of either 14-19 on BDI-II or 5-9 on GAD-7, a brief clinical interview is conducted, and the individual is referred to the Seeking Strength/Seeking Strength Program. If the individual obtains a score of 31 or higher on PCL-5, or a score of 20 or higher on BDI-II, or  a score  of  10  or  higher  on  GAD-7,  a  brief  clinical  interview  is  conducted,  and  the individual is referred to the Resolve Program in its entirety. Individuals may transfer to a Resolve Program institution to participate in the program.

Program Statement 5330.11 Psychology Treatment Programs requires  the  Trauma  Education Program  be  offered  at  all  female  institutions,  excluding  Federal  Transfer  Centers,  Federal Detention Centers, and Metropolitan Detention Centers -although  they  may  implement the program if available resources allow (PSB, 2016). In addition, Program Statement 5200.07 Female Offender  Manual requires  gender-responsive  programming  for  women  at  Federal  Detention Centers and Metropolitan Detention Centers, and  the Trauma Education Program meets this requirement  (WSPB,  2022) . The  Trauma  Education  Program  is  also  referenced  in Program Statement 5242.01 Management of Inmate Veterans .  Per this policy: 'Psychology Services staff at institutions with more than 50 Veterans offer the Trauma in Life or Seeking Safety workshops (females) and the Traumatic Stress and Resilience or Seeking Strength workshops (males) at least annually' (W SPB, 2022). The workshops are not required to be made up of only veterans but can include all individuals with trauma-related needs.

In the context of the Resolve Program, the Trauma Education program is facilitated by a Resolve Program Coordinator. As a stand-alone program, the program may be facilitated by a variety of Psychology Services Staff, including a psychologist or treatment specialist. No specialized training for program facilitators is noted. Successful completion of the program appears to be based on attendance  and  participation  to  include  completion  of  the  journal  and  the  post-program assessments. The program's anticipated outcome is an increased understanding of traumatic life

events and their impact, as well as participation in additional treatment for any trauma-related issues. Program outcomes are formally measured using the assessment instruments referenced above. In  addition,  given  the  program's  objective  to  encourage  participation  in  additional trauma-related programming, this could serve as a viable and easily accessible outcome measure.

In  the  BOP's  FSA Approved  Programs  Guide,  the  Trauma  Education  Program  is  described  as available  at  all  institutions;  however,  at  the  close  of  FY  2023  the  program  was  offered  at  76 institutions (BOP, 2023). This number may include instances when the program is offered as a component of the Resolve Program. In calendar year 2021, 2,143 individuals were enrolled in the program and 3,931 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022).  At the close of FY 2023, there were 1,004 individuals were participating in the program, up from 866 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 30.26% of the BOP population with a trauma need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).   It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 6.2.3 Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength Program

The Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength Program is intended to facilitate the resolution of mental health and substance use symptoms associated with traumatic life experiences. The program relies on  a  treatment  protocol  of  cognitive,  behavioral,  and  interpersonal  interventions developed by psychologist Dr. Lisa Najavits of Harvard Medical School and McLean Hospital. The target population for this program is individuals with a history of trauma-related mental health issues as well as substance use issues. The primary needs addressed by this program are trauma and substance use, but the BOP also notes the program addresses antisocial peers, cognitions, and mental health needs (BOP, 2022). At female institutions the program is referred to as the Seeking  Safety  Program  and  at  male  institutions  the  program  is  referred  to  as  the  Seeking Strength Program. The Seeking Safety Program was originally implemented in the agency in 2007 as  a  component  of  the  Resolve  Program.  Subsequently,  the  program  was  expanded  to  all institutions,  with  gender-responsive  revisions  to  serve  men.  As  noted  above,  individuals  are referred to the program based on the results of Trauma Education Program assessments.

The Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength Program is a 'present -focused, evidence-based approach to treat trauma symptoms and substance use concurrently' offering participants techniques to 'manage and decrease symptoms and gain control over both disorders by addressing current life programs' (BOP, 2022). Dr. Najavits' protocol is detailed in the book: Seeking Safety: A Treatment Manual  for  PTSD  and  Substance  Abuse (Najavits,  2001) . The  protocol  includes  facilitator guidance,  reproduceable  handouts  for  participants,  and  program  fidelity  and  satisfaction measures.  Program  interventions  include  facilitator-led  interactive  groups  and  homework

assignments from the manual. The 25 topics addressed in the manual include: Introduction/Case Management, Safety, PTSD: Taking Back Your Power, When Substances Control You, Honesty, Asking for Help, Setting Boundaries in Relationships, Getting Others to Support Your Recovery, Healthy  Relationships,  Community  Resources,  Compassion,  Healing  from  Anger,  Creating Meaning, Discovery, Integrating the Split Self, Recovery Thinking, Taking Good Care of Yourself, Commitment, Respecting Your Time, Coping with Triggers, Self-Nurturing, Red and Green Flags, Detaching from Emotional Pain (Grounding), Life Choices, and Termination (Najavits, 2001).

In  the  BOP,  the  Seeking  Safety/Seeking  Strength  Program  is  conducted  as  a  12-15  session treatment protocol, delivered in a group setting over the course of 12-15 weeks, in 60-minute sessions  (BOP,  2022;  PSB,  2016).  The  BOP's  internal  website  also  notes  the protocol  can  be delivered individually. The BOP's internal website suggests more sessions may be required for men at higher security levels, due to the challenges in establishing rapport. In the BOP version of the program, all 25 topics may not be addressed, and some topics may be delivered over multiple sessions (BOP, 2022; PSB, 2016; BOP, n.d.). This approach is not inconsistent with the protocol described by Dr. Najavits, as she notes topics can be offered in any order and as few or as many topics  as  ti me  allows  may  be  addressed  (Najavits,  2001).  The  BOP's  internal  website  offers facilitators considerable latitude, to include operating the group in a closed or open enrollment format (BOP, n.d.). A group size of 6-12 participants is recommended and the duration of each session may vary based on group size. The BOP's internal website notes a 12 -member group requires  sessions  of  80-120  minutes  to  accommodate  the  group  format  and  process  the treatment topic (BOP, n.d.).

The  BOP's  internal  website  outlines  a  format  for  each  session  consistent  with  Dr.  Najavits' protocol, which includes the following components: (1) A check-in by each participant answering four questions, i.e., how are you feeling, what good coping have you done, any unsafe behavior, did you complete your commitment? Check-ins are brief, no more than 5 minutes per participant. (2) A quotation is included with each session topic. A participant is asked to read the quotation and the group discusses what the quotation means to them. (3) Each group session is based on a specific  topic,  with  a  handout  provided  at  the  close  of  the  previous  session  to  prepare participants for the upcoming session. Each topic includes a facilitator guide to encourage and support disc ussion of the material, with a focus on relating the topic to the participants' lives. (4) A check out is conducted, with each participant offering what they learned from the session. Participants are also asked to make a new commitment. The commitment is a goal the participant sets for themselves to identify areas they need to work on and commit to actions to help them achieve these goals. In some circumstances the facilitator may assign a commitment (BOP, n.d.).

When implemented in the context of the Resolve Program, the Seeking Safety Program has a dedicated staff facilitator -the  Resolve  Program Coordinator. As a stand-alone program, the

program  may  be  'facilitated  by  independent  practitioners  or  mid -level  practitioners  with appropriate clinical supervision. Seeking Safety facilitators should be familiar with the three key areas  of  the  treatment  which  include  substance  abuse,  PTSD,  and  CBT.  If  a  facilitator  is  not familiar with one of these areas, specialized training or supervision is recommended.' (BOP, n.d.). Facilitators are also encouraged to read Dr. Najavits treatment manual, visit the Seeking Safety website, and view Seeking Safety Training Videos available on the website or borrowed from the PSB. The PSB also offers continuing education credit for reviewing two journal articles related to the Seeking Safety protocol. The Seeking Safety Adherence Scale is made available on the BOP's internal website, along with Practice Outcome Monitoring resources, including reference to a process measure contained in Dr. Najavits' workbook.  However, use of these fidelity tools is not mandated in policy.

The  Seeking  Safety/Seeking  Strength  Program is  referenced  in  multiple  BOP  policies.  In  the context of the Resolve Program, Program Statement 5330.11 Psychology Treatment Programs describes the purpose, target population, admission procedures, and treatment protocol for the Seeking Safety Program in some detail (PSB, 2016). Programming for women is also generally referenced in Program Statement 5200.07 Female Offender Manual (WSPB, 2022).  This program statement directs female institutions to provide at least one gender-responsive program from the  FSA  Approved  Programs  Guide  per  quarter  and  the  Seeking  Safety  Program  fulfills  this requirement. As noted above, the program is also referenced in Program Statement 5242.01, Management of Inmate Veterans and the Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength Program also meets programming requirements outlined in this policy (WSPB, 2022).

Successful completion of the program is based on achieving treatment targets, which include elimination of substance use, reduction in PTSD symptoms, and the development of safe coping strategies for use in the institution and upon reentry (BOP, n.d.). No specific requirements are outlined  in  policy  in  terms  of  a  minimum  number  of  sessions  or  degree  of  participation  for successful completion. Anticipated outcomes for the program are a reduction in the symptoms of trauma-related mental disorders, as well as the acquisition of coping-skills and a reduction in the risk of recidivism. The BOP's internal website offers three outcome measures which may be administered, although policy does not require their use. These measures include the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) (Briere, 1995), the Detailed Assessment of Posttraumatic Stress (DAPS) (Briere, 2001), and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) (Weathers, Litz, Huska, &amp; Keane, 1994).

In  the  BOP's  FSA  Approved Programs Guide, the Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength Program is described  as  available  at  all  institutions;  however,  at  the  close  of  FY  2023  the  program  was offered at 22 institutions (BOP, 2023).  This number may include instances when the program is offered as a component of the Resolve Program. In calendar year 2021, 109 individuals were

enrolled in the program and 136 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022).  At the close of FY  2023,  there  were  218  individuals  participating  in  the  program,  up  from  165  individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 2.64% of the  BOP  population  with  a  trauma  need  either  (1)  are  enrolled  in  the  program  or  (2)  have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 6.2.4 Cognitive Processing Therapy Program

The Cognitive Processing Therapy Program is designed for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, and other trauma-related mental disorders. Cognitive Processing Therapy was originally developed  in  the  Veterans  Administration  by  Drs.  Patricia  Resick,  Candace  Monson,  and Katherine Chard as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. The stated goal of the program is to provide treatment for trauma-related mental disorders, most notably post-traumatic stress disorder. Consequently, the target population for this program is individuals with a history of trauma-related  mental  illnesses,  e.g.,  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  depressive  disorders, anxiety  disorders.  Needs  addressed  by  the  program  include  trauma,  cognitions,  and  mental health.  Individuals  may  be  referred  to  the  program  based  on  the  results  of  the  targeted assessments referenced above (i.e., DAPS, TSI, PCL-C).

The  Cognitive  Processing  Therapy  Program  is  a  12session  intervention  combining  'cognitive techniques  with  written  exposure  therapy  to  address  negative  affect,  intrusive  images, dysfunctional thoughts, and avoidance behavior' (BOP, 2022).  In the BOP, the program consists of  60-90  minute sessions on a weekly basis over the course of 12 weeks. Curriculum for the program is found in the book, Cognitive Processing Therapy for PTSD: A Comprehensive Manual by  Resick,  P.,  Monson,  C.,  &amp;  Chard,  K.  (2016).  The  manual  includes  facilitator  guidance  and reproducible client handouts. Topics for each of the 12 sessions are as follows:  introduction and education, the meaning of the event, identification of thoughts and feelings, identification of stuck points, challenging questions, patterns of problematic thinking, challenging beliefs, safety issues, trust issues, power/control issues, esteem issues, and intimacy issues and meaning of the event (Resick et al., 2016). The protocol begins with psychoeducational information related to trauma, thoughts, and emotions, focusing on the relationship between automatic thoughts and the symptoms. The next phase of the program involves processing the trauma(s) by writing a detailed account to be read in session, with the facilitator helping to challenge unhelpful thoughts about the traumatic event. Of note, this component of the program is not required and may be omitted.  In  the  final  phase  of  the  program,  participants  continue  to  practice  evaluating  and modifying their beliefs related to traumatic events addressing key topic areas, e.g., safety, trust, power/control,  esteem,  and  intimacy.  The  program  can  be  delivered  in  a  group  setting,  or individually, and out-of-session practice assignments are also a component of the program.

A Cognitive Processing Therapy Adherence Scale is provided on the BOP's internal website as a program fidelity measure, along with copies of the basic therapist manual, group manual, and therapist and patient handouts (BOP, n.d).

In  their  clinical  practice  guidelines  for  the  treatment  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  the American Psychological Association strongly recommends Cognitive Processing Therapy as an intervention (APA, 2017). The protocol is also endorsed by the U.S. Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense, the International Society of Traumatic Stress Studies, and the U.K. National Institute  for  Health  and  Care  Excellence  (NICE)  as  a  best  practice  for  the  treatment  of  posttraumatic  stress  disorder.  A  meta-analysis  by  Amundson  et  al.  (2019)  concluded  Cognitive Processing Therapy outperformed inactive control conditions (e.g., wait list, placebo) and active treatments at the close of treatment on outcome measures related to PTSD and other mental health concerns; however, they did not find a significant difference between Cognitive Processing Therapy and other active treatments at the time of follow-up, i.e., 1-12 months post-treatment. The studies reviewed in this meta-analysis did not include a correctional population.

When the program is offered in the context of the Resolve Program, the program has a dedicated staff facilitator -the Resolve Program Coordinator. When offered as a stand-alone program, a psychologist also facilitates the program. The BOP's internal websi te provides links where staff can obtain training in Cognitive Processing Therapy, through the Veterans Administration and/or from  the  authors  of  the  protocol.  Facilitators  are  encouraged  to  read  Patricia  Resick's  book, Cognitive Processing Therapy for Rape Victims. Successful completion of the program is based on attendance  and  participation,  to  include  completing  out  of  session  practice  assignments.  In addition to reducing the symptoms of trauma-related mental disorders, the program is expected to produce a reduction in recidivism. Program outcomes are not formally measured, but mental health care level could serve as a viable outcome measure, as could re-administration of the assessments referenced above.

In  the  BOP's  FSA  Approved  Programs  Guide,  the  Cognitive  Processing  Therapy  Program  is described  as  available  at  all  institutions;  however,  at  the  close  of  FY  2023  the  program  was offered at 10 institutions (BOP, 2023).  This number may include instances when the program is offered  as  a  component  of  the  Resolve  Program.  In  calendar  year  2021,  12  individuals  were enrolled in the program and 11 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022).  At the close of FY 2023, there were 28 individuals participating in the program, consistent with the 27 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, .36% of the  BOP  population  with  a  trauma  need  either  (1)  are  enrolled  in  the  program  or  (2)  have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).   It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 6.2.5 Dialectical Behavior Therapy Program

The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Program is designed as 'a cognitive -behavioral treatment for selfmanagement of emotions and distress' (BOP, 2022). As noted above, the program is offered as  a  stand-alone  program  and  as  a  component  of  the  Resolve  Program.  Dialectical  Behavior Therapy skills t raining is also used within the STAGES Program, the BOP's residential treatment program for individuals with borderline personality disorder (see Chapter 5). Dialectical Behavior Therapy  was  originally  developed  by  psychologist  Dr.  Marsha  Linehan  of  the  University  of Washington as a treatment for borderline personality disorder. The stated goal of the program is to reduce life-threatening behaviors and therapy-interfering behaviors, while facilitating positive quality of life behaviors and skills acquisition. The target population for this program is individuals with a history of trauma-related mental illnesses, with a focus on individuals with personality disorders.  Needs  addressed  in  the  program  include  trauma,  mental  health,  and  cognitions. Individuals are referred to the program based on the results of the above referenced assessments and/or a borderline personality disorder diagnosis.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training focuses on four skill areas: 'mindfulness skills, distress tolerance skills, emotional regulation skills, and interpersonal effectiveness skills' (BOP, 2022). The reference to 'dialectical' relates to establishing 'a 'dialectic' between helping individuals to accept the reality of their lives and their own behaviors on the one hand and helping them learn to change tier lives, including dysfunctional behaviors, on the other' (APA, n.d.). As traditionally delivered, the protocol includes four components:  individual psychotherapy, skills training, inthe-moment phone coaching, and consultation teams for therapists (behavioraltech.com, n.d.). The protocol is found in the book, Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training Manual by Marsha Linehan,  with  client  resources  found  in  the  accompanying Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy Skills Training  Handouts  and  Worksheets, also  by  Dr.  Linehan  (2014).  In  addition,  the  website www.behavioraltech.org  contains  other  Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy  resource  materials,  to include program fidelity checklists and copies of evidence for the protocol's effectiveness.  This evidence includes randomized controlled trials associated with use of the protocol to treat a variety of conditions, i.e., borderline personality disorder, eating disorders, and depression. In most instances, these studies compared Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training to a wait list condition.  The limited number of studies available on the website comparing Dialectical Behavior Therapy  Skills  Training  to  treatment  as  usual  do  not  report  significant  differences  across treatment modalities.

In the BOP, the Dialectical Behavior Therapy Program focuses on the skills training component of Dr. Linehan's protocol, teaching these four core skills: (1) mindfulness, the practice of being fully aware and present in this one moment, (2) distress tolerance, how to tolerate pain in difficult situations, not change it, (3) interpersonal effectiveness, how to ask for what you want and say

no while maintaining self-respect and relationships with others, and (4) emotion regulation, how to change emotions that you want to change. Assigned homework is also an important part of the  skills  training  protocol.  The  program  is  implemented  as  a  25-session,  2-hours/session protocol.  When the program is offered in the context of the Resolve Program, the program has a dedicated staff facilitator -the Resolve Program Coordinator.  When offered as a stand-alone program,  a  psychologist  also  facilitates  the  program.  Facilitators  are  encouraged  to  read  Dr. Linehan's book, as well as the book Depressed and Anxious: The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Workbook for Overcoming Depression and Anxiety by Thomas Marra. The BOP's internal website notes this resource offers a simplified version of dialectical behavior therapy appropriate for individuals  suffering from mild to moderate anxiety and depression (BOP, n.d.). The author's book, Dialectical Behavior Therapy in Private Practice is also offered as a resource, especially the accompanying CD with client worksheets and skills training slideshows. Successful completion of the program appears to be based on attendance and participation in the program. In addition to reducing the symptoms of trauma-related mental disorders, the program is expected to produce a  reduction  in  self-harming  behaviors,  suicidal  ideation,  and  suicide  attempts  as  well  as  a reduction in recidivism. Program outcomes are not formally measured; however, a reduction in suicide risk assessments and suicide watches are viable outcome measures.

In  the  BOP's  FSA  Approved  Programs  Guide,  the  Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy  Program  is described  as  available  at  all  institutions;  however,  at  the  close  of  FY  2023  the  program  was offered at 46 institutions (BOP, 2023).  This number may include instances when the program is offered as a component of the Resolve Program or STAGES Program. In calendar year 2021, 71 individuals were enrolled in the program and 70 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 185 individuals participating in the program, up from 166 individuals  participating  at  the  program  at  the  close  of  FY  2022  (BOP,  2023;  BOP,  2022).  At present, 1.74% of the BOP population with a trauma need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023). It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## Women and Special Populations Branch Trauma Programs

The BOP offers three trauma programs supported by the WSPB and exclusively for women, and each of these programs addresses a specific trauma-related issue or population. The Advancing Career Counseling and Employment Support for Survivors (ACCESS) Program offers women who have experienced the trauma of domestic violence support in establishing independence from abusive relationships; the Beyond Violence: Prevention Program for Criminal Justice Involved Women  focuses  on  women  with  trauma-related  anger  management  issues; and  the  Pu'a Foundation Reentry Program addresses trauma issues from a culturally sensitive Native Hawaiian perspective.

## 6.2.6 Advancing Career Counseling and Employment Support for Survivors (ACCESS) of Domestic Violence Program

The Advancing Career Counseling and Employment Support for Survivors of Domestic Violence (ACCESS) Program is 'designed for incarcerated women who are survivors of domestic violence' (BOP, 2022). The program focuses on helping women identify career options to increase their economic  independence.  The  program  was  developed  by  Krista  M.  Chronister,  a  licensed psychologist known for her research on partner violence and survivors' vocational and economic development.    The  stated  goal  of  the  ACCESS  Program  is  to  aid  in  increasing  financial independence through employment; however, given its focus on domestic violence, this program was not categorized as a vocational training program for the purposes of this report. The target population for this program is women with a cognitions, mental health, or trauma need.

The ACCESS Program is a 5-week, 10-hour program consisting of a combination of lectures, class discussions, and computer-based resources. These resources include an interactive component to  explore  career  options  as  well  as  a  self-assessment  to  identify  the  best  career  fields  for participants. The program aims to enhance domestic violence survivor's career development by '(a) increasing women's awareness of supportive and abusive power dynamics in their lives, (b) increasing women's awareness and developmen t  of  occupational and life skills, (c) facilitating women's ability to use their skills to make life decisions, and ultimately, (d) increasing women's ability  to  use  their  skills  to  contribute  to  their  families  and  communities'  (Chronister,  2013). Program  sessions  are  as  follows:  (1)  introductions,  a  discussion  of  accomplishments,  and introduction of the skills assessment activity; (2) review of skills assessment activity results and discussion  of  career  resources;  (3)  discussion  of  power  and  control  in  relationships  and  a progressive relaxation exercise; (4) discussion of equality and support in relationships; (5) career goal planning exercise with a focus on a 2-year career vision. Program resources available on Sallyport  include  Powerpoint  presentations  on  power,  control,  equality,  and  support;  an introductory  questionnaire;  a  skills  assessment  instrument  with  supporting  documentation; session  satisfaction  surveys  for  participants  and  facilitators;  a  progressive  relaxation  exercise outline; and personal sa fety plan outline.  According to the developer's website, resources also include  a  facilitator's  curriculum  manual  and  participant  workbooks,  as  well  as  a  career information system and program CD available on the ACCESS website. However, the website does not appear to be active, and these materials are not accessible at this time.

The  program  does  not  have  a  dedicated  staff  facilitator.  According  to  the  BOP  (2022),  the program  is  facilitated  by  a  special  programs  coordinator.  No  formal  training  is  required  to facilitate the course, nor does the agency provide any formal training to facilitators, apart from the  facilitator  guide.  Successful  completion  of  the  program  is  based  on  attendance  and

participation. The program's anticipated outcome is increased assertiveness and a career path plan. Program outcomes are not formally measured.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the ACCESS Program is described as available at all female institutions; however, at the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 1 institution (BOP,  2023).  In  calendar  year  2021,  22  individuals  were  enrolled  in  the  program  and  28 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 8 individuals participating  in  the  program,  whereas  at  the  close  of  FY  2022,  there  were  no  individuals participating in the program (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, .17% of incarcerated women in the  BOP  either  (1)  are  enrolled  in  the  program  or  (2)  have  completed  the  program  since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for the program, or why there are so few participants in the program.

## 6.2.7 Beyond Violence: Prevention Program for Criminal Justice Involved Women

The Beyond Violence: Prevention Program for Criminal Justice Involved Women is focused on anger management issues. The program is 'designed to assist women in understanding trauma, the aspects of anger, and emotional regulation' (BOP, 2022). The program was developed by Stephanie  Covington,  a  psychologist  and  social  worker.  The  stated goal  of  the  program  is  to reduce the risk of violence. The target population for this program is women with anger/hostility and cognitions needs.

The Beyond Violence Program is a 40-hour, 20-session program consisting of a combination of education, role plays, and cognitive-behavioral techniques, e.g., mindfulness activities, grounding skills.  The program is 'an evidence -based manualized curriculum for women in criminal justice settings…with  histories  of  aggression  and/or  violence'  (Covington,  2013).  Program  modules address the interplay between individual, relationship, community, and societal factors putting people at risk for experiencing and/or perpetrating violence. Each module includes quiet time, a lecture, group discussion, and a series of activities.  Following an initial orientation session, the module topics are thinking our thoughts, feeling our feelings, violence and trauma in our lives, the effects of trauma, women and anger, understanding ourselves, our families, communication, power  and  control,  conflict  resolution,  creating  our  relationships,  our  communities,  the importance  of  safety,  creating  communities,  the  power  of  community,  society  and  violence, creating  change,  transforming  our  lives,  honoring  ourselves  and  our  community  (Covington, 2013).  Resources for the program include a facilitator guide, participant workbook, and DVD, available on the Covington Books website.

The  program  does  not  have  a  dedicated  staff  facilitator.  According  to  the  BOP  (2022),  the program  is  facilitated  by  a  special  programs  coordinator.  No  formal  training  is  required  to

facilitate the course, nor does the agency provide any formal training to facilitators, apart from the facilitator guide which does provide specific guidance to facilitators. Successful completion of the program is based on attendance and participation. Th e program's anticipated outcome is a  reduction  in  the  symptoms  of  anger  and  hostility.  Program  outcomes  are  not  formally measured.

In  the  BOP's  FSA  Approved  Programs  Guide,  the  Beyond  Violence  Prevention  Program for Criminal Justice Involved Women is described as available at all female institutions; however, at the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 3 institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, 57 individuals were enrolled in the program and  58 individuals completed the  program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 53 individuals participating in the program, up from 33 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 1.80% of incarcerated women in the BOP either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023). It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 6.2.8 Pu'a Foundation Reentry Program

The Pu'a Foundation Reentry Program is a program grounded in Hawaiian culture. The program focuses on 'families affected by trauma and incarceration with a special emphasis on women, girls, and Native Hawaiian participants' (BOP, 2022). The program was developed by the Pu'a Foundation, a non-profit organ ization  with  a  mission  to  'actively  engage, facilitate  and  serve communities and their efforts to build a resilient society and improve quality of life through healing and reconciliation efforts' (Pu'a Found ation, n.d.). The stated goal of the program is to support  healing.  The  target  population  for  this  program  is  Native  Hawaiian  women  with family/parenting and trauma needs.

The  Pu'a  Foundation  Reentry  Program  consists  of  a  12 -week  course  with  20  hours  of programming, the Cultural Healing and Well Being Course. The Cultural Healing and Well Being Course  focuses  on  'sharing  Native  Hawaiian  culture  and  history'  with  the  aid  of  c ommunity educational resources, i.e., Ua Mea Ke Ea textbook and DVD. Resource materials are available on the foundation's website. A Pre Transition Course focused on 'life success planning for women -about to exit prison and connecting resources to actual n eeds' is also available (Pu'a Foundation, n.d.). As noted above, resources for the Pu'A Foundation Reentry Program include a textbook and DVD, made available to the institution via the foundation's website.

The  program  does  not  have  a  dedicated  staff  facilitator.  According  to  the  BOP  (2022),  the program  may  be  facilitated  by  a  variety  of  staff,  including  Education  and  Unit  Team  staff, contractors, and volunteers. No formal training is required to facilitate the course, nor does the

agency provide any formal training to facilitators, apart from the referenced textbook and DVD. Successful  completion  of  the  program  is  based  on  attendance  and  participation.  A  fidelity checklist for the program is available on the BOP's internal website (WSPB , n.d.).  The program's anticipated outcome is not clearly stated. Program outcomes are not formally measured.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Pu'a Foundation Reentry Program is described as available at FDC Honolulu; however, at the close of FY 2023 the program was not offered at the institution (BOP, 2022). In calendar year 2021, no individuals were enrolled in the program and no individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were no individuals  participating  in  the  program,  nor  were  there  any  individuals  participating  in  the program  at  the  close  of  FY  2022.  No  women  currently  in  BOP  custody  are  noted  to  have completed the program in the past. It is not clear why there are no participants in the program in recent years.

## 6.3 Study Identification Procedures

To  create  our  study  database,  we  first  examined  all  published  meta-analyses  and  systematic reviews of prison-based trauma programs published during our review period (2000-2022). Three meta-analyses  and  systematic  reviews  were  identified  (See  Appendix  Table  6A).  All  studies identified in each of these meta-analyses and systematic reviews and published from 2000 to present were included in our preliminary study review database. As noted in Chapter 1, a strong argument can be made evaluations of prison trauma programs operating in the 1990's and earlier are  not  relevant  today,  because  of  changes  in  program  design  components and incarcerated populations.

The next step in our study identification process was to determine whether these meta-analyses and  systematic  reviews  perhaps  missed  relevant  evaluations  due  to  the  search  procedures employed; or excluded them from their review due to their study inclusion criteria. Based on the topics covered in this chapter, we decided to use an expanded electronic database search by including all databases available from UMass Lowell's entire Discovery Service:

- · APA PsycInfo
- · Complementary Index
- · Academic Search Premier
- · MEDLINE
- · Criminal Justice Abstracts
- · CINAHL Plus with Full Text
- · Gale Academic OneFile

- · National Criminal Justice Reference Service Abstracts
- · Gale OneFile: Health and Medicine
- · Gale General OneFile
- · Supplemental Index
- · Education Research Complete
- · Gale Academic OneFile Select
- · Springer Nature Journals
- · Books at JSTOR
- · Research Starters

- · Gale in Context: Science
- · Gale OneFile: High School Edition
- · IEEE Xplore Digital Library
- · Regional Business News
- · ERIC
- · Gale OneFile: News
- · Historical Abstracts
- · Political Science Complete

We used the following specific terms for our systematic search of electronic databases:

(trauma informed care OR trauma informed practice OR trauma OR trauma informed approach) AND (prison OR jail OR incarceration OR imprisonment OR correction facilities) NOT (youths OR young people OR adolescents OR teenagers) AND (recidivism OR reoffending OR repeat offenders)

This search yielded 265 hits, with an initial list of 108 studies once duplicate articles across the databases  were  removed.  Visual  inspection  of  the  titles  and  abstracts  by  the  research  team further reduced the number of potential studies to 20 titles identified by the research team as requiring in-depth review. Specifically, we focused on studies that included one of the outcomes

measures described  in  Chapter  1  (i.e.,  recidivism  reduction,  misconduct  reduction,  improved institutional adjustment, skills acquisition) and identified a control group for comparison. 1

In addition, the BOP provided us with an unpublished preliminary internal evaluation report for the Resolve Program which was included in our database. The individual studies are presented in Appendix Table 6B.

Not all the 20 studies we examined in-depth met our review criteria. Based on our review of the studies included in the eight meta-analyses and systematic reviews highlighted in Appendix Table 6A, along with the results of our search of electronic databases and the report provided to us by the BOP, we identified 20 evaluations of prison-based trauma programs for the period 2000 to 2022 that meet our review criteria (see Appendix Table 6B for an overview of each study).

## 6.4 Evaluations of Trauma Programs Inside the BOP

Six of  BOP's eight  trauma  programs -Trauma  Education,  Seeking  Safety/Seeking  Strength, Cognitive Processing Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, ACCESS, Beyond Violence: Prevention  Program  for  Criminal  Justice  Involved  Women,  and Pu'a  Foundation  Reentry Programs -have not been the subject of either an internal or external BOP evaluation during our

2000-2023 review period.  However, the BOP is conducting an internal evaluation of the Resolve Program, which appears to include two of these stand-alone programs -Trauma Education and Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength (DOJ, 2023). The BOP recently completed a preliminary report related to this evaluation, which they shared with our review team near the close of our project (ORE, 2023). The program is described as follows:

' The  Resolve  Treatment  Program  (RTP)  was  designed  to  treat  those  inmates  suffering  from trauma-related disorders. Broadly, the RTP is a group-based treatment protocol that includes one psychoeducational and three treatment groups. The three treatment groups are Seeking Safety, Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy  (DBT),  and  Cognitive  Processing  Therapy  (CPT).  All  phases  are designed  to  treat  symptoms  of  PTSD,  substance  abuse  and  other  traumarelated  disorder' (2023,1).

Researchers were not able to use a research design that included a treatment and control group, so  they  opted  to  simply  examine  pre-program  vs.  post-program  changes  in  incident  reports, major psychological services events (MPSEs), and days in restrictive housing units ( i.e. SHU)  for a group of  program participants, which varied significantly by the outcome measure used (n=409 misconduct; n=296 for time in SHU, and n=88 for MPSEs). While no differences in misconduct were found, pre-post differences in both time in SHUs and MPSEs were identified. Limitations of this preliminary, level 1 study were identified by the research team, who correctly observed that,

' While this analysis points to a positive impact on the behavioral outcomes measured here, it is not enough to show the causal impact of this trauma- informed intervention. Nor does it show us the effect of this programing compared to a group of similarly situated individuals who did not participate in the RTP '(2023 , 3).

Currently,  BOP  does  not  have  plans  to  conduct  an  external  evaluation  of  any  of  its  trauma programs.  Without  high  quality  evaluation  findings,  we  will  not  be  able  to  determine  the effectiveness -in-prison and post-release -of these programs.

## 6.5 Evaluations of Trauma Programs Outside BOP

We begin our assessment of programs targeting incarcerated  individuals with trauma-related needs  by  looking  first  at  the  results  of  available  meta-analyses  and  systematic  reviews.  The findings  from  three  recent  meta-analyses  and  systematic  reviews  examining  trauma-focused interventions (Malik et al., 2021; Tripodi et al., 2011; and Givens et al., 2021) are presented in

Appendix Table  6A . 2 Only  the  Malik  et  al.  (2021)  meta-analysis/systematic  review  focused exclusively  on  prison-based  trauma  programs,  but  there  were  a  small  number  of  trauma programs included in the other two systematic reviews, which is why the findings from these reviews are also included here. Overall, these three meta-analyses/systematic reviews underscore the need for more research evaluating the intermediate program effects of traumafocused interventions in prison, based on a standard set of outcome measures. The authors of three separate meta-analyses/systematic reviews reported positive overall findings regarding the reduction of PTSD and other trauma-related symptoms for several different trauma-focused interventions. However, the authors of these three meta-analyses/systematic reviews caution readers  that  the  research  base  supporting  the  efficacy  of  these  interventions  is  limited.  The following  summary  of  findings  offered  in  the  meta-analysis/systematic  review  conducted  by Malik and colleagues (2021: 8) bears careful consideration as BOP assesses the status of their trauma-focused programming:

Overall, our results highlight that published literature on the efficacy of trauma-focused therapies in prison settings is sparse and its interpretation is challenging. The lack of studies trialing robustly controlled NICE  recommended  trauma-specific  therapeutic  approaches  likely  reflects the difficulties  with  which  the  delivery  of  such  therapy  in  prison  presents.  This  is  consistent  with previous prison studies which have found PTSD to be significantly under-treated compared to other disorders (Jakobowitz et al., 2017; Tyler et al., 2019). The most widely implemented traumafocused  interventions  across  studies  in  our  review  were  group-based,  phase  1  treatments, addressing current trauma-related distress and functioning through skills-based work aimed at increasing  safety  and  stability. We  identified  five  studies  which  involved  trauma-processing components, with only one evaluating an evidence-based, NICE-recommended therapy for the treatment of PTSD. The most commonly evaluated trauma processing approach were traumafocused writing interventions, which were not delivered by qualified psychologists or other mental health professionals.

As we noted in our review of prison programs targeting serious mental illnesses (see Chapter 5), these trauma programs should be evaluated on whether they achieve their intended outcome, which is reduction in trauma symptoms. Of particular interest is whether proposed new trauma programs perform better than existing programs, i.e., treatment as usual (TAU). If they do not,

then  BOP  program  administrators  are  free  to  consider  other  factors  (e.g.,  cost,  training, qualifications of staff) when establishing policies and practices in this program area.

The meta-analysis of 16 prison-based trauma programs by Malik and colleagues (2021) did not include a single study with recidivism outcomes. Similarly, Givens et al. (2021) did not include studies with recidivism outcomes for the trauma programs in their systematic review. Only the Tripoldi et al. (2011) systematic review of a variety of women's programs included risk reduction outcomes, but these outcomes were reported only for substance abuse programs, not trauma programs.  While  there  will  always  be  interest  in  assessing  post-release  behavior  of  prison treatment program participants, it is the evidence of in-prison program effects -reduced PTSD, and other trauma symptoms--that can be directly linked to prison trauma programs; there is little evidence  that  in-prison  trauma  programs  have  an  impact  on  post-release  behavior  in  the community. Since men and women in prison are typically involved in multiple types of prison programs,  disentangling  individual  program  effects  post-release  is  difficult,  if  not  impossible, especially when participation in post-release treatment -and supervision -is not also assessed.

Appendix Table 6B provides an overview of the key findings from our review of 18 individual trauma-focused interventions. Since these studies use a range of outcome measures, a summary of  study  findings  is  challenging.  Eleven  of  the  studies  we  reviewed  used  3  or  more  outcome measures, three studies used 2 outcome measures, and four used only 1 outcome measure. The most often-used measure was PTSD (11 studies), followed by depression (8 studies), trauma (4 studies),  personality  disorders  (2  studies),  substance  use  (1  study),  misconduct  (1  study), restrictive housing placement (1 study), crisis contacts (1 study), and recidivism (1 study). 3

Several of the programs included in our evaluation review appear to be similar -at least in name--  to  a  current BOP trauma program, the Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength Program. Of the 18 trauma program evaluations included in Appendix Table 6B , six are evaluations of Seeking Safety Programs.  Two  other  program  evaluations  also  relate  to  programs  offered  in  the  BOP  -  the Beyond Violence Prevention Program for Criminal Justice Involved Women and the Dialectical Behavior Therapy Program . In addition, two studies focus on a treatment intervention closely linked to dialectical behavior therapy, the STEPPS Program. Five program evaluations address additional psychoeducational interventions and/or exposure-based therapies, including Survive

and Thrive, TARGET, Helping Women Recover/Beyond Trauma, SHARE, and Traumatic Incident Recovery.  There is also a single program evaluation for a Transcendental Meditation Program.

Our examination of these 18 trauma-related program evaluations points to a generally favorable review, in terms of the short-term reduction in trauma symptoms by participants, but several evaluators report that similar reductions in symptoms were also identified in the various control groups employed. We also note that only one study provided data on recidivism (the Kubiak et al., 2016 evaluation of the Beyond Violence Program), which limits our assessment of this postrelease  outcome.  In  the  Kubiak  et  al.  study,  no  statistically  significant  differences  between treatment and control groups were found for both re-arrest and reincarceration at 12-months post-incarceration;  similar  no  effect  findings  were  reported  for  relapse,  using  positive  drug screen as the outcome.

One component of BOP's Resolve Program is their Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength Program. As we  mention  above,  there  were  six  separate  state-specific  evaluations  of  the  Seeking  Safety Program available for review: Barrett et al. (2015), Tripodi et al. (2019), Zlotnick et al. (2009), Lynch  et  al.  (2012),  Heath  (2009),  and  Wolff  et  al.  (2015).  Four  of  these  evaluations  were randomized control trials, while two were quasi-experiments. Regardless of design type or how the  trauma  outcome  measures  were  operationalized  by  researchers,  the  results  of  these  six evaluations revealed a similar pattern: significant pre-post improvements in one trauma-related outcome (PTSD symptom severity) were identified in both the  treatment and control groups, which suggests that the Seeking Safety Program does not offer an improvement over current practices (i.e., treatment as usual) in these prison systems. However, in one study, participants in the Seeking Safety Program did have better outcomes than a control group that received no treatment, using three different trauma-related outcome measures: mental health symptoms, self-esteem,  and  proactive  coping  (Wolff  et  al.,  2015).  In  this  same  study,  there  was  some preliminary evidence that the Male Trauma Recovery Empowerment Model (MTREM) may work better at reducing PTSD severity than the Seeking Safety Program. We view these overall results as evidence that (1) when it comes to addressing trauma-related problems, some treatment is better than no treatment; but (2) there is research evidence that suggests that the Seeking Safety Program may not offer any improvement over current practice. For this reason,  we rate it as ineffective, but  it  is  important  to  note  that  both  the  treatment  and  TAU  groups  showed improvements in trauma-related outcomes.

In addition to the six Seeking Safety Program evaluations, our review includes evaluations of six trauma-treatment programs with potential similarities to BOP programs: Mahoney et al., 2020; Swopes et al., 2017; Cole, 2007; Ford et al., 2013; Valentine &amp; Smith, 2001; and Karlsson, 2022. The programs described in these six evaluations include both psychoeducational and exposurebased therapies.  The results of the higher quality research studies conducted by Mahoney et al.

(2020) and Swopes et al. (2017) revealed no differences in trauma outcomes between treatment and control groups for psychoeducational-based interventions. The results from the three lowerlevel studies addressing exposure therapies were mixed.  We rate both these types of trauma programs as ineffective .

The one high quality evaluation of Dialectical Behavior Therapy we reviewed (a level 3 study by Bradley &amp; Follingstad, 2003) identified in-prison improvements in trauma symptoms, including depression.  We rate the in-prison intermediate effects of this program as promising . No postrelease  measures  were  included  in  this  study;  the  post-release  effects  of  this  program  are unknown.

## 6.6 Trauma Program Comparability Assessment

As noted above, the BOP's trauma treatment protocol, the Resolve Program, includes a suite of programs.  While we did not identify a program comparable to the Resolve Program, we do note two  of  the  Resolve  Program  components  are  directly  comparable  to  programs  found  in  our review  of  the  literature -the  Seeking  Safety/Seeking  Strength  and  the  Dialectical  Behavior Therapy Programs.  These programs are referenced in the following studies, not all of which met our review criteria: Barrett et al. (2015), Tripodi et al. (2019), Zlotnick et al. (2009), Lynch et al. (2012), Heath (2009), Wolf et al. (2015), Bradley &amp; Follingstad (2003), Black et al. (2008), Black et al. (2013). Based upon our review of program descriptions in these evaluations, these programs appear very comparable to the BOP's programs. T hese programs were developed outside of the BOP, adopted by the BOP in a manner consistent with their developer's model , and implemented in  the  referenced  studies  in  this  manner  as  well.  Consequently,  these  two  programs  can  be classified as very comparable to the research we reviewed.

In addition, the Survive and Thrive Program described in the Maloney et al. (2018) study appears to  share  many similarities  with  the  BOP's  Trauma  Education Program. Both programs can be described  as  brief,  purely  psychoeducational,  group  interventions.  Whi le  the  BOP's  Trauma Education Program is eight hours, the Survive and Thrive Program is slightly lengthier at ten hours.    Based  on  content,  dosage,  and  delivery  method,  we  would  characterize  the  Trauma Education  Program  and  Survive  and  Thrive  Program  as  somewhat  comparable.  The  other program with a significant psychoeducational component, TARGET , is lengthier at 15 hours, and includes skills training which is not found in the Trauma Education Program. However, we did not identify sufficient research to assess the effectiveness of psychoeducational interventions, so a full comparability assessment is not relevant.

Although  the  BOP's  Cognitive  Processing  Therapy  Program  is  not  represented  in  the  current literature  on  correctional  programs,  an  element  of  the  program  is  shared  with  the  programs

discussed  in  our  review -exposure  therapy.    However,  it  is  important  to  note  the  exposure portion of Cognitive Processing Therapy is optional, so a meaningful comparison cannot be made to this program and the exposure-based programs found in our review.

With respect to the three trauma programs supported by the WSPB, only one program has been subject to an evaluation - the Beyond Violence: Prevention Program for Criminal Justice Involved Women. The program evaluated in the 2016 Kubiak et al. study appears to be the same program offered  by  the  BOP,  as  both  programs  use  program  materials  developed  by  Dr.  Stephanie Covington  and  adhere  to  the  program  structure  contained  in  these  materials.  Consequently, these two programs appear to be very comparable.

No comparable programs were identified for the ACCESS and Pu'a Foundation Reentry Programs.

## 6.7 Trauma Program Recommendations

In  the  BOP's  most  recent  needs  assessment report, compliance with the ACES assessment is noted to be relatively low. Ideally, new procedures related to earned time credits have increased compliance with self-report assessment measures. If not, the BOP may want to identify a proxy measure for individuals who refuse to complete the ACES, such as a review of the individual 's PSR to identify traumatic events.

The  BOP's  current  approach  to  assessing  trauma -related  needs  focuses  on  the  presence  of trauma,  as  opposed  to  the  presence  of  a  trauma-related  impairment.    To  streamline  the assessment and make more efficient use of resources, it might be of value to reframe trauma as a potential underlying cause of another need, e.g., mental health, cognitions, substance abuse. Assuming  any  individual  with  a  history  of  trauma  has  a  trauma-related  need  does  not  give sufficient weight to the concept of personal resilience.  Assessment measures used in the Resolve Program appear to offer more appropriate methods to assess trauma-related needs.  A more efficient  approach  might  be  to  use  the  ACES  in  conjunction  with  other  needs  assessment measures to refine treatment recommendations.  For example, program referrals for individuals with substance use disorders might vary based on whether the individual also has an elevated ACES score.

In  concluding  comments,  the  Malik  et  al.  (2021)  meta-analysis/systematic  review  addresses implications for policy and practice by discussing provisional conclusions drawn about the most effective approaches to addressing trauma-related mental disorders.  In their comments, they suggest individual interventions may be more effective than group interventions, an important consideration since BOP programs in this area are delivered primarily in a group setting.  The authors  also  suggest  stabilization  interventions  (e.g.,  Seeking  Safety  Program)  may  be  less

effective than trauma-processing interventions (e.g., Cognitive Processing Therapy Program).  In line  with  these  suggestions,  the  BOP  may  want  to  consider  increasing  the  availability  of  the Cognitive Processing Therapy Program as an individual intervention by providing additional staff training and/or directing more individuals to this intervention.  Rather than referring individuals who score highly on the PCL-C to the Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength Program, these individuals might be referred to the Cognitive Processing Therapy Program.  Of course, as noted in our review of the literature, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn at this time, and a formal evaluation of the Cognitive Processing Therapy Program is necessary as our review did not support its status as an EBRR Program.

As  noted  in  Chapter  5,  with  the  residential  treatment  programs  for  individuals  with  serious mental illnesses, clarity in program participation numbers is lacking. From a tracking standpoint, the  use  of  trauma-treatment  interventions  both  within  the  broader  Resolve  Program  and independent of the program is problematic.  For example, do the 28 individuals reported to be participating in the Cognitive Process Therapy Program at the close of FY 2023 reflect all the individuals participating in this program, or are there additional participants within the Resolve Program participation numbers?

The  Resolve  Program  is  described  in Program  Statement  5330.11  Psychology  Treatment Programs which supports the use of fidelity measures within this program and its component programs.  This  policy  should  be  updated  to  include  recent  program  enhancements,  i.e., expansion of the program to serve men, refinement of screening methods, the use of traumatreatment interventions outside the context of the Resolve Program.  For example, the trauma programs  offered  by  the  BOP  now  include  several  targeted  assessments  both  for  program placement (i.e., GAD-7, BD-II, PCL-5) and as potential outcome measures (i.e., TSI, DAPS, PCL-5). The  programs  could  be  strengthened  by  incorporating  requirements  to  administer  these assessments into policy as well as by requiring staff to re-administer relevant assessments at the conclusion  of  the  programs  to  serve  as  consistent  outcome  measures.    Given  the  significant number of changes in the program since issuance of the policy, it might be more effective and efficient to create a stand-alone policy for trauma programs.

With respect to the three trauma programs supported by the WSPB, we question whether these programs add significant  value  to  the  BOP's  trauma  programming  efforts.  The re  is  a  lack  of research support for these Productive Activity Programs. The one study we identified related to the Beyond Violence: Prevention Program for Criminal Justice Involved Women did not support its effectiveness, and we did not identify any studies related to the two other WSPB supported programs. In addition, participation in these programs is quite low, with fewer than 100 women combined participating in the three programs at the close of FY 2023. On the other hand, in the Resolve  Program  and  its  components,  the  BOP  has  a gender-responsive  approach  to  trauma

programming staffed by doctoral level psychologists with experience in treating trauma-related mental illnesses. The BOP might benefit from reallocating its WSPB resources to interventions outside the trauma domain, such as gender-responsive programming related to communication skills and relationships.

As noted above, the BOP's ORE is currently evaluating the effectiveness of the Resolve Program. This  evaluation  is  particularly  important  as  BOP  has  classified  most  of  its  trauma-treatment programs as EBRR Programs.  Our review has not supported this classification with a correctional population.  The  evaluation  by  ORE  should  address  all  components  of  the  Resolve  Program, including Cognitive Processing Therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy since these components have been classified by the BOP as stand-alone EBRR Programs.  Completing this evaluation will allow the BOP to capitalize on its unique strengths, i.e., doctoral level treatment providers and programs  with  high  retention  rates,  which  may  enhance  program  effectiveness.  With  this additional data the BOP can make more informed decisions about treatment resources in this area.  As with the BOP's programming choices related to individuals with serious mental illnesses, there is merit in the selection of programs with empirical support outside of corrections, but there is a need to ensure these programs are effective with a correctional population, especially if the BOP chooses to classify the programs as EBRR Programs.

## 6.8 Summary of Results

Four of eight BOP programs examined in this chapter are currently classified by BOP as EBRR Programs  -  the  Resolve,  Seeking  Safety/Seeking  Strength,  Cognitive  Processing  Therapy,  and Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy  Programs.  Based  on  our  review  of  the  evaluation  research conducted on these programs published between 2000 and 2022, we did not find support for continuing to classify three of these programs as EBRR Programs. With respect to the Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength Program, while this program was found to favorably impact traumarelated symptoms, the program was not found to perform significantly better than treatment as usual, an issue we address in Chapter 1 of this report.  As a major component of the Resolve Program, this finding related to the Seeking Safety/Seeking Strength Program also impacts our view  of  the  Resolve  Program.  With  respect  to  the  remaining  two  programs  -  the  Cognitive Processing  Therapy  and  Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy  Programs  -  we  did  not  find  sufficient evidence  to  support  classification  of  the  Cognitive  Processing  Therapy  Program  as  an  EBRR Program,  but  we  did  find  support  to provisionally classify  the  Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy Program as an EBRR Program. Until additional evaluations of these programs are conducted, and a body of quality evaluation research is available for review, there is no justification for classifying the majority of these programs as EBRR Programs.

We were also asked to assess trauma programs currently classified by the BOP as PA Programs -the  Trauma  Education,  ACCESS,  Beyond  Violence  Prevention  Program  for  Criminal  Justice Involved  Women, and Pu'a  Foundation  Reentry  Program s;  however,  our  review  did  not  find sufficient research to make any determination about their PA Program designations. Once again, the necessary research has not been conducted. At this point, findings related to the Beyond Violence Prevention Program for Criminal Justice Involved Women are not encouraging, rated as not promising based on a single review finding no differences between the treatment and control groups.

The table below provides a summary of the results of our research review.

Individual trauma therapies were found to be significantly more  effective at reducing trauma-related symptoms compared to group  interventions.  Phase 1 stabilization interventions were effective in reducing trauma  symptoms, but stronger effects noted in phase 2 trauma processing  interventions, based on cognitive processing therapy, NICE- recommended trauma-focused CBT, trauma incident reduction, or  expressive trauma-based writing exercises, were more effective. |

Studies  including both  women and  men in sample  were included  only if separate  results for  women were  reported. | 24 studies:   8 RCTs, 7 quasi- experiments, 9 used  one-group pretest- post-test designs.  6 risk reduction  model studies  18 enhancement  model studies   2 had outcomes for  both risk reduction  and enhancement. | 9 studies included in this meta-analysis examined psychological well- being outcomes for females (6 RCTs and 3 quasi-experiments).  Moderate effect sizes noted.  Authors reported that 'overall, our systematic review showed that  women who participate in correctional-based interventions tend to  improve their psychological well-being as compared to women who  did not participate in such programs.' (25) In terms of recidivism reduction, they found that 'the three studies  with the largest demonstrated reduction in recidivism were  evaluations of prison-wide therapeutic community programs designed  to reduce substance abuse.'

| 1) Ford et al.  (2013) | TARGET program  'A group psychotherapy  designed to enhance  affect regulation without  trauma memory  processing - Trauma  Affect Regulation: Guide  for Education and Therapy  (TARGET) - was compared  to a supportive group  therapy (SGT) in a  randomized clinical trial  with 72 incarcerated  women with full or partial  PTSD.' (262) (York Correctional  Institution in Connecticut) | Randomized Control Trial (RCT):  'Randomized Control Trial with  two groups (72 participants  total). To achieve a randomized  design, participants were  placed in cohorts of N= 10 - 12  as they enrolled in the study,  and cohorts were randomly  assigned to first receive one of  the two group therapies. After  completing the assigned group  therapy, participants in each  cohort were re-tested for the  posttreatment assessment, and  then provided the other group  therapy. Posttreatment data  collected following the first  type of group therapy that each  participant received are  reported in order to avoid a  confounding of the effects of  the two therapies. Participants  were informed during the  consent process that they  would receive two group  therapies believed to be helpful  for women coping with stress,  with a 50-50 chance of  receiving either type of group  therapy first.' (264) | 5  -  'Of 197 women screened,  80 were eligible and  randomized (by a study  assessor with numbers  concealed in sealed  envelopes prepared by  another study staff who used  an Excel random number  generator). ' (265)  38  participants received the  TARGET therapy first, 32  participants went through  SGT therapy first. Results  were compared after the first  therapy was completed. | 'Dropout rates were very low (5%) compared to those  reported in prior studies of group therapy with  incarcerated women (approximately 33%). However, full  remission from PTSD occurred for only 12% to 23% of  participants. The reduction, on average, in CAPS PTSD  severity was comparable to that reported by Zlotnick  and colleagues (2009), i.e., approximately 12 to 13  points, but only half the amount of improvement  reported in studies of TARGET as a one-to-one therapy  for women and girls.' (271) 'TARGET did not achieve greater improvement in affect  regulation than SGT. The small increase in Negative  Mood Regulation (NMR) scores achieved on average by  TARGET recipients suggest that the gains in affect  regulation from brief group therapy may not be  sufficient to reverse the trend of worsening affect  dysregulation that has been documented among  incarcerated women over time.' (271) 'TARGET participants' increase in sense of forgiveness  (while SGT participants reported a decrease). This  finding suggests that a therapeutic focus on affect  regulation may provide a basis for incarcerated women  with PTSD to achieve a greater sense of emotional  resolution in relation to past victimization or betrayal.'

The participants  experienced improvements in BPD-related symptoms,  mood, and negative affectivity. Importantly, the data  show a significant reduction in the number of  suicide/self-harm behaviors and disciplinary infractions  occurring in prison. Thus, the benefit of STEPPS seems to  extend beyond subjective experience, and the program  may help correct an individual's behavior.

The program consists of 20 2- hour weekly sessions with  facilitators who follow  detailed lesson plans.   The program involves  psychoeducation about BPD,  emotion-management skills  training, and behavior- management skills training.  The first component teaches  subjects to replace  misconceptions about BPD  with an awareness of the  thoughts, feelings, and  behaviors that define it, and  to identify their own schemas  (i.e., cognitive filters) that  drive their behaviors. The  second component teaches  skills to better manage the  cognitive and emotional  effects of BPD: distancing,  communicating, challenging,  distracting, and problem  management. The third  component teaches  behavioral skills that subjects  are encouraged to master: | ' The women who participated in the STEPPS program  experienced significant and clinically meaningful  improvement across a spectrum of illness-specific  measures, in their negative affectivity, and in their  mood. These results are encouraging because they  suggest that a relatively brief adjunctive program for  BPD can deliver "real world" benefit to offenders and  improve quality of life. The effect sizes reported herein  are simi lar in magnitude to those reported in our RCT. 28   This project also shows that STEPPS can be successfully  implemented in a prison setting without modifying the  existing manual, and that incarceration is not a barrier to  improvement. ' (885) ' The STEPPS program helped subjects to better  understand their BPD and taught them new skills to  better manage their disorder. Of course, the program  may have provided social support, hope and therapeutic  alliance, factors common to most forms of therapy. The  results also suggest that the women were less likely to  feel hopeless and helpless or to have negative self- impressions. These changes reflect the emphasis of the  program on instructing subjects to self-regulate their  intense emotions and maladaptive behaviors.

(Federal Bureau of  Prisons) | 897 women who completed the  program during the reference  period of 2014-2019.  A retrospective evaluation of  the effects of program  participation on behavioral  outcomes. Modeling  approaches in the study  resulted in a large number of  subjects being excluded from  aspects of the study (ranging  from excluding 488-830  subjects).  Subjects had to meet  observation criteria for 365  days pre- and post-program  participation.  Outcome measures:  misconduct, Major Psychology  Services Events (MPSEs) (e.g.,  crisis intervention, disruptive  behavior, suicide risk  assessments), restrictive  housing placements. | 1 -  'The first set of models  utilized conditional logistic  regression to determine if  there was a change in the  probability of any of the  outcome measures during  the post treatment risk  period. The second round of  modeling used conditional  Poisson models to determine  the extent to which change in  the number of events in the  outcome measures from pre  to post program.' (2) Limitations: methodological  approach, large number of  excluded subjects, lack of  access to clinical outcome  measures. | 'Overall, the results from the fixed effects analysis  showed support for the impact of the RTP on post  program behaviors of those who completed treatment.' (2)  For misconduct: '…we found a 10.4% decrease on  average from pre to post program misconduct events.  However, this was not statistically significant, and we  cannot conclude there was a difference between risk  periods. The same held true for the probability model:  Although the direction of the estimated coefficient was  in the expected direction (decrease), it was not  statistically significant.' (2) For restricted housing placements: 'The estimated  coefficient from the count model was in the expected  direction and statistically significant, indicating  suggesting that the number of restrictive housing days  decreased over the observation periods. The estimated  coefficient [in] the conditional logistic model was also  significant, indicating that the odds of being placed in  SHU decreased 28.7% from the pre risk period to the  post risk period.' (2 -3)  For MPSEs: 'The estimated coefficient for the number of  MPSE was in the expected direction (decrease) but was  not statistically significant. As with the conditional  logistic model for SHU, the same analysis for MPSE  showed a statistically significant decrease in the odds of |
