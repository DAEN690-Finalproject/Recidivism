"In addition, the BOP provided us with an unpublished preliminary internal evaluation report for"
the Resolve Program which was included in our database. The individual studies are presented in
Appendix Table 6B.
Not all the 20 studies we examined in-depth met our review criteria. Based on our review of the
studies included in the eight meta-analyses and systematic reviews highlighted in Appendix Table
"6A, along with the results of our search of electronic databases and the report provided to us by"
"the BOP, we identified 20 evaluations of prison-based trauma programs for the period 2000 to"
2022 that meet our review criteria (see Appendix Table 6B for an overview of each study).
