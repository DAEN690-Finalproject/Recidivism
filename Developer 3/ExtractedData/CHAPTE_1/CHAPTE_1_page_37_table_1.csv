of the interventions","focused interventions; none of these studies examined post-program
impact on recidivism post-release.
The 2 Seeking Safety program evaluations reported overall
improvements in trauma-related outcomes; but one study (Zlotnick et
al., 2009) found no significant differences between treatment and
control groups.
Limitations: There were significant differences in intervention
program models, intervention types (group, individual, blended,
milieu), and outcome measures. In addition, sample size was very
small for most studies, with only 3 studies with sample sizes over 60.
Due to these limitations, no conclusions can be reached about the
impact of these multiple programs on the various trauma-related
outcomes measured."
