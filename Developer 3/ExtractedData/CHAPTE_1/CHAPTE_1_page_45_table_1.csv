participants were assigned to
the treatment or waitlist
condition on the basis of
anticipated release or
transfer dates. This method
of assignment was chosen
because the prison
administration could not
support keeping all
participants (treatment and
waitlist) for the 24 weeks
necessary to offer waitlist
and treatment via random
assignment; thus, prison staff
ultimately determined which
individuals would receive
treatment immediately or
after a waitlist period based
on estimated release/transfer
dates.” (93)","Participants in both conditions demonstrated
improvements in PTSD symptoms. “However, offenders
who participated in SS appear to have benefited
significantly more than the waitlisted individuals given
their decreased symptoms of depression, improved
interpersonal functioning, and decreased maladaptive
coping.” (98)
“Although the treatment gains from the time-limited SS
intervention are modest, given the extent of trauma
exposure and distress reported by these study
participants, these results are promising and suggest the
need for further assessment.” (98)"
