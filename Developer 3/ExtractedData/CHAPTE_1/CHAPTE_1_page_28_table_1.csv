,"Barrett et al. (2015), Tripodi et al. (2019), Zlotnick et al. (2009),"
"Lynch et al. (2012), Heath (2009), and Wolff et al. (2015). Four of these evaluations were",
"randomized control trials, while two were quasi-experiments. Regardless of design type or how",
"the trauma outcome measures were operationalized by researchers, the results of these six",
evaluations revealed a similar pattern: significant pre-post improvements in one trauma-related,
"outcome (PTSD symptom severity) were identified in both the treatment and control groups,",
which suggests that the Seeking Safety Program does not offer an improvement over current,
"practices (i.e., treatment as usual) in these prison systems. However, in one study, participants",
in the Seeking Safety Program did have better outcomes than a control group that received no,
"treatment, using three different trauma-related outcome measures: mental health symptoms,",
"self-esteem, and proactive coping (Wolff et al., 2015). In this same study, there was some",
preliminary evidence that the Male Trauma Recovery Empowerment Model (MTREM) may work,
better at reducing PTSD severity than the Seeking Safety Program. We view these overall results,
"as evidence that (1) when it comes to addressing trauma-related problems, some treatment is",
better than no treatment; but (2) there is research evidence that suggests that the Seeking Safety,
"Program may not offer any improvement over current practice. For this reason, we rate it as",
"ineffective,",
