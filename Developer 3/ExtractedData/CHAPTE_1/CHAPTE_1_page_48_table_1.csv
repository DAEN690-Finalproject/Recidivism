treatment program for
persons with BPD that
combines cognitive
behavioral elements with
skills training but does not
involve individual therapy.
The program consists of 20
two-hour weekly sessions
with therapists who follow
detailed lesson plans. (We
generally recommend having
two co-therapists.) Key
elements include
psychoeducation about BPD,
emotion management skills
training, and behavior
management skills training. A
systems component is unique
to the program. For the
prison setting, this involved
one-time 2-hour evening
sessions for system members.
In addition to family
members and friends,
corrections officers and other
staff members are in
attendance. These individuals
are educated about BPD and

male and female offenders with BPD. The participants
experienced improvements in BPD-related symptoms,
mood, and negative affectivity. Importantly, the data
show a significant reduction in the number of
suicide/self-harm behaviors and disciplinary infractions
occurring in prison. Thus, the benefit of STEPPS seems to
extend beyond subjective experience, and the program
may help correct an individual’s behavior. The
magnitude of change is consistent with what has been
reported for STEPPS programs conducted in the
community in the United States, United Kingdom, and
Holland.” (127)
“The data show that STEPPS can be successfully
transported to the correctional setting ‘‘as is’’ and
without modification.” (128)"
