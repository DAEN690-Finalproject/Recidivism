by Lipsey and Wilson

in calculating effect
sizes, while
supplemental
analyses applied the
equations noted in
prominent meta-
analysis handbooks.”
(606)","“Drawn from 15 studies, 57 effect sizes were
calculated to estimate the average impact of
religious prison programming on inmate
attitudes and disciplinary infractions. Producing
a weighted mean effect size of −.23 (g = −0.45
for attitudinal adjustments, g = −0.15 for
institutional misconduct), the results indicate
that religious interventions produce a modest
but significant alteration to offender values and
behaviors.” (600)
“There were no significant differences in mean
effects on attitude alteration or inmate
misconduct despite differences in
programmatic components: worship service
attendance, faith education courses, or church
leadership training. However, interventions
with mentorship or individualized spiritual
counseling produced larger effects than those
programs that excluded this feature, t = 4.012,
p < .001. Likewise, prison programs that
included group Bible study as an element of the
intervention demonstrated a more substantial
impact, t = 2.246, p < .05. However, a meta-
ANOVA demonstrated no significant within-
versus between-group differences in effect
sizes among all programmatic components of
the intervention, F = 2.563, p = .076.” (612)"
