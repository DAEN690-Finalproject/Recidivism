TC model, highly
structured faith-
based, volunteer-
led program. Phase
1, 12-months,
includes 3-hours of
instruction each

work/educational
programming in the
afternoon and
evening
programming as

were compared with 366
non-participants released
from Minnesota prisons
between 2003-2009.
Four separate measures
of recidivism were used:
rearrest, reconviction,
reincarceration for a new
felony, and revocation for
a technical violation.","3 - Well-controlled
quasi-experimental
design.
Controlled for 27
covariates including
demographics,
criminal history,
recidivism risk,
religious affiliation,
offense type,
misconduct,
participation in prison
programming, and
type of post-release
supervision.
Observable selection
controlled by using
propensity score
matching.","The program significantly reduced the risk of rearrest,
reconviction, and reincarceration, but did not significantly
impact the risk of a revocation. The hazard of recidivism was
lowered by 26% for rearrest, 35% for reconviction, and 40%
for a new offense reincarceration.
The researchers note advantages of this program over other
faith-based programs may include use of the TC model,
targeting of criminogenic needs, i.e., criminal thinking, and
the continuity of care provided by mentors in the program."
