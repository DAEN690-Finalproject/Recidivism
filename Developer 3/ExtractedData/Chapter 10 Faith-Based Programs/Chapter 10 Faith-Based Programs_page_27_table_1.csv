“From available data, there are however
indications showing that RS is associated with
lower frequency and severity of depression.
The strongest reported effect of RS on prison
life is a reduction of incidents and disciplinary
sanctions.” (294)

impact on inmates’ behaviour by reducing
arguments, violence and disciplinary

the author
characterizes this","“So, after discarding the faith-based prison
studies tainted by self-selection bias, we’re left
with two studies that find no effect of faith-
based programs, one study that’s too small to
be meaningful, and three studies that find
some effect, even if the effect that a few of
these find is quite weak. And of those three,
two aren’t about prisoners at all, but about
after-care of released prisoners, and the
remaining one shows no significant effect once
the prisoners have been released. So we have
no study that actually finds a significant effect
of an in-prison faith-based program on
recidivism.” (89-90)"
