groups for comparison
purposes.","“We found a modest positive effect in recidivism outcomes
when comparing inmates from Wakulla Correctional
Institution [FCBI] to the wait list comparison group. The risk of
recidivating for Wakulla inmates relative to the wait list
counterparts was 0.85. This relative risk of 0.85 means that
inmates released from Wakulla were 15% less likely to
reoffend than similar inmates on the wait list. We found less
of an effect for the faith- and character-based correctional
institutions of Lawtey (0.94 or 6% less likely to reoffend) and
Hillsborough (0.95 or 5% less likely to reoffend). We found no
substantive differences in recidivism for the inmates in the
faith- and character-based dorm programs compared to their
counterparts on the wait lists when controlling for factors
related to recidivism.” (9)"
