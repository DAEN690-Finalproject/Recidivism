returns to prison occurring within the first year after release.
“In general, 37.9% of the sample did return to prison within
the first year after being released, 41.7% returned to prison
within 2 years, and 43.1% returned within 3 years.
Half of the sample comprise men who are part of the MOV
program. Of this amount, about 3% participated in the 6-
month aftercare, whereas 1% were program participants in
the year-long aftercare program.” (101)
“Our estimates suggest that the program has been beneficial
in reducing recidivism rates for program participants.
Benchmark estimates imply that the program was associated
with estimated reductions in the probability of recidivating of
6.0 to 8.7 percentage points. This effect is statistically
significant as it implies a 15.8% to 19.2% reduction in the
probability of returning to prison after first release. Our
results are robust when we correct for sample selection based
on unobserved heterogeneity.” (116-117)"
