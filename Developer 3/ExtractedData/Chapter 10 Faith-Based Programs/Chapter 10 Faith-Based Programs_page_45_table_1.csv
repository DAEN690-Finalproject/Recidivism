2 medium security
facilities, with at least 8
months remaining on
their sentence.
A battery of self-
administered
psychological tests (Beck
Depression Inventory
(BDI), Cook and Medley
Hostility Scale, Toronto
Alexithymia Scale,
Psychomatrix Spirituality
Inventory, Rosenberg
Self-Esteem) was
administered pre- and
post-program. In
addition, disciplinary
records for 4 months
prior and 4 months
following the
intervention were
collected. A subgroup of
20 subjects also
participated in structured
interviews on a wide
range of topic areas.","1 - Uncontrolled,
weakly designed pre-
/post-test
comparisons of a
relatively small
sample.","“Changes in the number of disciplinary reports pre- and post-
testing appeared to be statistically insignificant.” (6)
BDI: “Participants showed a decrease in depression scores
between pre-testing (M = 15.6415, SD = 8.5330) and post-
testing (M = 10.5625, SD = 6.7398). ANOVA indicated that this
change was statistically significant (p = 0.0001).” (6)
Cook and Medley Hostility Scale: “Participants showed a
decrease in hostility scores between pre-testing (M =
26.8696, SD = 7.9741) and post-testing (M = 23.6667, SD =
8.7307). ANOVA demonstrated that this decrease was
statistically significant (p = 0.026).“ (6)
The Toronto Alexithymia Scale: Participants scores on the
alexithymia scale decreased between pre-testing (M =
61.5625, SD = 10.7938) and post-testing (M = 57.4375, SD
9.7061). ANOVA indicates that this decrease was statistically
significant (p = 0.052).” (7)"
