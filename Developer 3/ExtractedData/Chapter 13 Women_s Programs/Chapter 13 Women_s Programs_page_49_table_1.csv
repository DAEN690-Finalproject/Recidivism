were gauged using self-

included the Borderline
Evaluation of Severity
Over Time (BEST) to
assess thoughts, feelings,
and behaviors associated
with BPD; the Beck
Depression Inventory
(BDI) and the Positive and
Negative Affect Schedule
(PANAS) to assess
positive and negative
dispositions.","treatment program
for persons with BPD
that combines
cognitive-behavioral
elements with skills
training but does not
include individual
therapy. The program
consists of 20 2-hour
weekly sessions with
facilitators who follow
detailed lesson plans.
The program involves
psychoeducation
about BPD, emotion-
management skills
training, and
behavior-
management skills
training. The first
component teaches
subjects to replace
misconceptions about
BPD with an
awareness of the
thoughts, feelings,
and behaviors that
define it, and to
identify their own
schemas (i.e.,
cognitive filters) that
drive their behaviors.
The second
component teaches
skills to better
manage the cognitive
and emotional effects
of BPD: distancing,","improvement across a spectrum of illness-specific
measures, in their negative affectivity, and in their mood.
These results are encouraging because they suggest that a
relatively brief adjunctive program for BPD can deliver
""real world"" benefit to offenders and improve quality of
life. The effect sizes reported herein are simi lar in
magnitude to those reported in our RCT.28 This project also
shows that STEPPS can be successfully implemented in a
prison setting without modifying the existing manual, and
that incarceration is not a barrier to improvement.
The STEPPS program helped subjects to better understand
their BPD and taught them new skills to better manage
their disorder. Of course, the program may have provided
social support, hope and therapeutic alliance, factors
common to most forms of therapy. The results also
suggest that the women were less likely to feel hopeless
and helpless or to have negative self-impressions. These
changes reflect the emphasis of the program on
instructing subjects to self-regulate their intense emotions
and maladaptive behaviors. The women also had high
levels of satisfaction with the program.‚Äù (885)"
