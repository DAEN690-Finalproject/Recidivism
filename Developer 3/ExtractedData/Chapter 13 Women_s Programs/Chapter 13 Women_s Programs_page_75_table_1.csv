equivalent control
group, pre/post-test
design.
A series of analysis
revealed no significant
differences between
the treatment and

treatment.
Limitations: Results
based on treatment
completers, significant
attrition from the
original sample of 119
in the treatment
group and 42 in the
control group.","Significant increases in parenting knowledge and skills of
individuals who completed the program. Parents were
more likely to understand their children’s feelings and
needs.
Specifically, results indicate “increased child development
knowledge, changed views of corporal punishment and
parent-child role reversal, and increased empathetic
awareness” toward their children. (441)
No significant increase in feeling supported in their
parenting efforts, no significant increase in satisfaction
with being a parent, and no significant change in perceived
communication ability."

attitudes improved from the beginning to the end of the
parenting classes and showed a marginal additional
increase at the 8-week follow up. The size of the increase
was small at each point. The subtle improvement supports
the program’s attempt to allow mothers to become more
nurturing toward their children.” (22)"
