Program
Group-based mood
management training
and standard behavioral
techniques to prevent
smoking relapse.
10-weeks of
once/weekly group
sessions, as well as
nicotine replacement
therapy initiated in
week 3, with attempts
to quit between weeks
3-4.
(Virginia DOC)","360 incarcerated women,
who smoked at least 5
cigarettes per day and
expressed interest in
smoking cessation.
Treatment group of 250
women; control group of
289 women.
Control group was on a 6-
month waiting list.
Data collected 2004-
2006.","5 - RCT with 6-month
waitlist control group
and large sample size.","“The intervention was efficacious compared with the
waitlist control group. Point prevalence quit rates for the
intervention group were 18% at the end of treatment, 17%
at 3-month follow-up, 14% at 6-month follow-up, and 12%
at 12-month follow-up, quit rates that are consistent with
outcomes from community smoking-cessation
interventions.” (1894)
One week after targeted quit date, there was a
significantly greater increase in smoking abstinence for the
intervention group compared with the control group.
Significance in abstinence between groups remained until
6 months after completion of the intervention. For the
intervention group, there was a gradual decline in
abstinence from week 5 till the 6-month follow-up point."

Intervention
Changes to diet by a
nutritionist paired with
encouragement to
increase physical
activity over 1 year.
(Prison in Huelva, Spain)","Subjects were 139 men
and women who had
potential cardiovascular
risk factors or cachexia
due to HCV/HIV or
needed special diets.
44 subjects were lost in
the follow-up study, and
95 completed the
program (7 women and
88 men). Average
program stay was 6.6
months.","2 - Longitudinal
nonrandomized
cohort study with a
number of objective
measures of program
success.
The specific role of
physical activity in this
study is not clearly
articulated; the focus
is primarily on diet
changes produced by
a nutritionist.","Significant differences compared with baseline for body
composition variables and diastolic blood pressure. Non-
significant differences compared with baseline for all
clinical variables except triglycerides, blood glucose, and
glycated hemoglobin. Significant reduction in the number
of participants with metabolic syndrome according to IDF
criteria."
