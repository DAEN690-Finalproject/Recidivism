"To create our study database, we first attempted to identify all published meta-analyses or"
systematic reviews of prison-based women’s programs published during our review period
"(2000-2022). Based on this search, we identified four meta-analyses and systematic reviews of"
"the empirical literature on women’s programming within correctional settings, including one"
meta-analysis also included in Chapter 6 of this report. See Appendix Table 13A for an overview
"of these meta-analyses and systematic reviews. As noted in Chapter 1, a strong argument can be"
made evaluations of prison-based women’s programs operating in the 1990’s and earlier are not
"relevant today, because of changes over time in program design components and incarcerated"
"populations. In fact, the programs addressed in this chapter were developed in the 2000’s and"
"later. In addition, many of the studies contained in these meta-analyses and systematic reviews"
"were addressed in other chapters of this report, as they involve programming categories serving"
"both men and women, e.g., trauma programs, substance use treatment programs. As noted"
"previously, this chapter focuses on programming available exclusively to women, for which"
comparable programming for men does not exist.
We then searched a series of electronic databases in an effort to identify individual studies
relevant to this portion of our review. We searched the following databases:
