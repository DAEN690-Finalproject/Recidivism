some participation in religious activities.
“Inmates who received high-level support from
participation in religious activities reported significantly
less depression, recounted perpetrating fewer aggressive
acts, and committed fewer serious institutional infractions
than those who did not attend religious activities as well as
those who attended but reported receiving low-level
support. In addition, inmates reporting a high level of
support through their religious activities reported fewer
instances of feeling angry, having arguments with inmates
and correctional officers, physical fights, and injury than
those who reported no participation in religious activities.”

With respect to the more objective measure of
institutional misconduct: “Inmates who did not indicate
religious participation (M 4.48, SD 5.42) and those who
attended but reported no or little support (M 4.84, SD
5.85) were significantly more likely to accrue major (200-
level) violations than those who reported receiving high
support from religious participation (M 2.45, SD 3.83).” (5)"
