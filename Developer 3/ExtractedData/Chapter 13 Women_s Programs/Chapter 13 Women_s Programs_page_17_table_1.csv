We used the following search terms for our systematic search of electronic databases:
(women OR females) AND (services OR programs OR intervention) AND (prison OR jail OR
incarceration OR imprisonment OR correction facilities) AND (recidivism OR reoffending OR
repeat offenders) NOT (youth OR adolescents OR children OR teens)
Specific women’s programs in this chapter were also keyed into the database search replacing
"the first two clusters of key words on women’s programming with: “FIT Program”, “Assert"
"Yourself for Female Offenders”, “Foundation”, “Change Plan”, “Square One Essentials for"
"Women”, “Understanding Your Feelings”, “Women's Reflection Group”, “Women's Relationships"
"I”, and “Women's Relationships II”. Each unique search yielded 0 new hits."
"This search yielded 252 hits, but that number was reduced to 244 studies due to duplicates across"
the databases. Visual inspection of the titles and abstracts by the research team further reduced
"the number of potential studies to 37 requiring in-depth review. Specifically, we focused on"
"studies that included one of the outcomes measures described in Chapter 1, identified a control"
"group for comparison, and addressed the type of programming contained in this chapter, e.g.,"
"relationships, communication skills, understanding feelings. A number of the studies identified in"
this search were identified in previous searches involving programming addressed in other
"chapters of this report. For this reason, they were not considered relevant to this chapter."
