Significant reductions in post-release substance use were
found for men, but not women: “About 59% of untreated
men would relapse to drug use compared with 50% of
treated men. A similar pattern of reduced drug use
associated with in-prison treatment was found among
women: 43% of untreated women relapsed compared
with only 35% of those women who were treated.” (156)"

reported that “WOSAP treatment programs were
