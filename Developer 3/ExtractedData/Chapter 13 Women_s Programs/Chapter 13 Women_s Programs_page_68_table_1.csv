Intervention
(Virginia DOC)","179 females who were
wait-listed for 6 months
prior to an intervention.
Compared two groups
based on whether they
self-selected to reduce
smoking prior to their
cessation attempt (n=77)
or whether they
increased smoking or did
not reduce it (n=102).
Data collected 2004-
2006.","1 - Comparison of two
groups based on
differences in smoking
behaviors pre-
treatment.","While not a program evaluation per se, this study explored
whether motivation to quit or an intent to quit alone was
sufficient to produce a change in smoking behavior,
independent of program participation.
“Participant-initiated pre-cessation smoking reduction may
be initially helpful in preparing to quit smoking, or may
serve as a marker for participant motivation to quit
smoking, but these differences do not sustain over time.
More intensive interventions are still needed for successful
cessation.” (73)
“Our study showed that smokers who reduced prior to
their quit attempt showed better cessation rates during
initial post-quit weeks of the smoking cessation program
than did those who did not reduce. However, these effects
disappeared by the end of treatment and at follow-up
points.” (77)"
