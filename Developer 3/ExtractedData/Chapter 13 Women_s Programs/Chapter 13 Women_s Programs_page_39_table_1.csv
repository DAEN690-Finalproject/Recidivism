program
Assessment of Beyond
Violence (BV) — a 20-
session curriculum-
based intervention for
women. The program
“has a core goal of
preventing recidivism
and further violent
behavior by women
who have already
engaged in violence; it
also aims to improve
women’s mental health
and anger expression
and reduce substance
use.” (663)
Study setting was a
female-prison in a
midwestern state.","Randomized Control Trial:
“At the point of prison
treatment, a randomized
control trial was
designed, assigning
women to receive one of
two treatments in 1:1
ratio. Randomization
selection criteria for the
intervention study
included conviction of a
violent offense,
substance abuse
dependency or positive
drug screen during
incarceration, no serious
mental health issue that
specifically involved
housing on the mental
health unit, and eligibility
for release on parole
within 18 to 24 months.”
(664-5)","4: RCT design,
relatively small
sample size. “35
women were included
in the analysis, with
the independent
variable being
treatment condition
(TAU n =16; BV n =
19). Of the women
involved in this study,
there were no
differences in
measures of mental
health (i.e.,
depression, anxiety,
PTSD) at pretest. All of
the women in the BV
condition completed
the treatment
intervention (defined
as 75% or more of the
sessions), but 5 of the
women in the TAU
condition did not
complete treatment.","The study “found no differences between the treatment
groups on demographic characteristics of age at offense
(M= 30.26, SD = 9.17), age at time of treatment (M =
33.66, SD = 8.91) or race (46% White, 54% African
American). Although all women had a current or previous
offense categorized as an assaultive felony, there was a
greater period of time between prison treatment
admission and release onto parole status for women in the
BV condition as compared to the TAU (562 days vs. 378
days; t = 2.88, p =.007).” (667)
“In terms of recidivism, no woman from either condition
returned to prison during the 12-month study period,
which suggests that none of the women in the sample
committed any serious offense or parole violation. When
using arrest as an outcome, 11% (n = 2) of BV women and
38% (n = 6) of TAU women had evidence of a new arrest
(x2 = 3.58; p = .06).” (667)
“There were no significant differences between groups on
any of the variables associated with relapse. Of the 34
women, 13 had at least one positive drug screen during
the 12-month post incarceration period; 5 (26%) were
from the BV condition, and 8 (50%) were from the TAU
group (x2 = 2.09; p =.15).” (669)"
