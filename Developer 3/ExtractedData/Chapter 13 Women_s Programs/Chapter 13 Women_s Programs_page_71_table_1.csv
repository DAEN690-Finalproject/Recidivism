reported feeling significantly less depressed than control

preintervention scores, inmate gender and age, and total
family contacts in prison, participants assigned to the
intervention condition reported significantly more positive
interaction postintervention (b 1⁄4 .254, p 1⁄4 .02). At
mean levels of the control variables, participants in the

noted for likely to play an active role in the child’s life,
closeness to caregiver, or ease of relationship with
