Increased their parental knowledge of child development
and child guidance skills, particularly the female study
participants. (70) The authors state that this is particularly
noteworthy given that the study participants were likely
raised by parents without adequate child-rearing skills,
and interventions such as AAPI help break the
intergenerational cycle of poor parenting.
“Results of pre-post assessments showed a significant
improvement in parents’ reported sense of efficacy and
satisfaction in the parenting role; their knowledge, skills,
and behavior as a parent; their understanding of child
development; their knowledge of alternatives to
using corporal punishment; establishing appropriate
parent-child boundaries; and they were less likely to view
their child’s independence as a threat. Females showed a
significant decrease in distress symptoms.” (62)
“Results showed that, with gender collapsed, participants
scored significantly higher (p < .05) on the posttests than
the pretests for all dependent variables except the Brief
Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the Empathy subscale from
the Adult-Adolescent Parenting Inventory (AAPI-2). For the
BSI, participants scored significantly lower on the posttest
than the pretest (p = .001), which was in the expected
direction indicating a decrease in psychological distress.
For the Empathy subscale, the mean difference was in the
expected direction and showed a trend, but it was not
statistically significant (p = .06).” (68)"
