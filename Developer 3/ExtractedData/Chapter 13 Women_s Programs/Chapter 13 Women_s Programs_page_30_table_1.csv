The authors note: “This does not amount, to
date, to a robust evidence base.” (133) Also,
authors acknowledge the lack of quality
research on interventions targeted to women
with “multiple mental health issues and
complexities” (151); the result being programs
that have demonstrated efficacy with other
populations are provided to women offenders
without evidence of applicability."

Study quality overall
was noted to be low.","“The review highlighted a lack of evidence for
the efficacy of offense-specific interventions
facilitated with women and limited use of
recidivism as an outcome measure within the
literature, despite often being a key aim of the
interventions.” (291)
The researchers noted “…there is less emphasis
in the literature on the use of offence-specific
interventions with women who offender and
greater emphasis on interventions directly
addressing the criminogenic needs of women
including trauma, mental health, and substance
misuse.” (314)
The researchers also noted few programs were
developed specifically for women, thus testing
offense-specific interventions for women has
led to low quality studies due to lack of
comparisons with benchmarks or accepted
percentages. (314)."
