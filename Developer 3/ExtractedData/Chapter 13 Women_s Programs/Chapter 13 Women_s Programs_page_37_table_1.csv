experimental design. A
cohort of 1,685 female
FPI participants were
compared to a matched
group of 1,685 female
non-participants on
recidivism outcomes
(rearrest, return to
prison, time to arrest /
recommitment).","3 – Adequately
designed quasi-
experiment with
propensity score
matching on key
demographic and
sentence and criminal
history background
characteristics. Only
individuals with at
least 1 year in FPI
were included in these
analyses, which
removes a significant
group of individuals
from the original
cohort. The non-
participant group only
includes individuals
who were never in
FPI. No information
included about the
types of FPI programs
that women","This study only provides follow-up data on recidivism
outcomes. Rearrest rates 3 years post-release were 14.4%
for FPI participants of at least 1 year vs. 15.8% for non-
participants; return to prison rate for FPI participants was
7.8% vs. 8.5% for non-participants. These differences were
not statistically significant. Separate analyses of the
potential impact of length of time in FPI employment on
recidivism did not reveal any significant impact of length of
employment on post-release recidivism. According to the
author. “This suggests that a longer length of
employment…does not provide an added benefit in terms
of reducing the likelihood of recidivism upon release.”
