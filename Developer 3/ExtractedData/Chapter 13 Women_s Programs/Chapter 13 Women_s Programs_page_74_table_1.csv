(Virginia DOC)","176 incarcerated mothers
with at least one child
under 18: ultimately
there were 46 mothers in
a waitlist control group
compared to 60 mothers
in the intervention group.
Outcome measure:
Parenting Stress Index
(PSI), Child Contact,
Parenting Alliance
Measure (PAM), Brief
Symptom Inventory, self-
reported usage of
program skills.","3 - RCT, pre/post-test
design, with
significant attrition.
Limitations: Results
based on treatment
completers only,
significant attrition,
reliance on self-report
related to behavior
change.","“After intervention, mothers reported reduced parenting
stress, improved alliance with home caregivers, increased
letter-writing, and reduction of mental distress symptoms.
Large drop-out rates in both subgroups may have reduced
the benefits of the random assignment used to form
groups.” (89)
The authors note that while there were promising pre-post
comparisons in the treatment group, when compared to a
waitlisted control group, aside from one stress scale,
“there were no differences in change patterns between”
the two groups. (99)"

Outcome measures were
collected pre-treatment,
at the end of treatment,
and 6 months after
release from prison:
Difficulties in Emotion
Regulation Scale (DERS),
Maternal Emotional Style
Questionnaire (MESQ),
and Center for
Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale.","3 - Quasi-
experimental
unmatched control
group, pre/post-test
design with 6-month
post prison follow-up.
Limitations: Results
were based on
treatment completers.","Initial results, as indicated by moderate effect sizes,
suggest that the participants in the Emotions program
“promoted increases in mothers’ effortful control as a
measure of reactivity, prevented increases in mothers’
dismissing of children’s emotions, and effected decreases
in mothers’ dismissing of children’s emotions, and effected
decreases in mothers’ criminal behavior over time.” (7)
Mothers in both groups decreased in emotion
dysregulation over time. However, moderate effects were
observed for “aspects of emotion regulation, emotion
socialization behavior, and criminal behavior in mothers,
with participants in the Emotions condition showing
improvement relative to those in the comparison
condition.” (1)"
