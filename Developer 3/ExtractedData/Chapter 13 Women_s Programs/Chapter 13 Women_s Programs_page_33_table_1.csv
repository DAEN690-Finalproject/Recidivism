in overall satisfaction with their relationship after
completing the program, regardless of their gender and
racial/ethnic background.” (341)
“…significant differences from pre to post were observed
for all variables. There was no evidence of significant
gender by time interactions, consistent with our
expectations that males and females would similarly
benefit from the program.” (349)
The most significant effect sizes were noted for
improvements in communication skills and negative
interactions, though improvements were also seen in
relationship confidence and satisfaction as well as overall
loneliness. (351)"
