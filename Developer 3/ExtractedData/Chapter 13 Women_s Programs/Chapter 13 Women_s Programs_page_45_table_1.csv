Research Design:
“The HWR/BT combined

from 95 incarcerated

seven dependent variables, only posttraumatic cognitions
showed significant between-group decreases. PTSD
symptoms and substance-related self-efficacy
demonstrated pre–post, but not between group
differences. The present findings are consistent with many
previous studies of integrated trauma-focused treatments
for PTSD-SUD that have failed to find a unique advantage
over comparison groups.” (1157)
Further, “no pre–post or between-group differences were
found for depression, anxious arousal, dissociation, or
tension reduction.” (1159)"
