(Oregon DOC)","Intake survey data from
807 individuals admitted
to the Oregon DOC in
2004; of this number 571
were released within the
window required for this
study, an 8-year fixed
follow-up period. The
intake survey inquired
about religious
identification and
affiliation, religious
history, religious
orientation, and spiritual
coping. Approximately
25% of individuals agreed
to complete the survey.

recidivism were noted to","1 - Correlational study
based in part on self-
report survey data.
Individuals were
classified as spiritual
and religious; spiritual
only; religious only, or
neither based on
survey data.
Limitations: lack of
clarity regarding the
nature of HSR
services, impact of
uncontrolled
variables.","“A little under 70% (n=399) of our sample was rearrested for
any new offense within 8 years after release from prison.”

“Predictably, inmates who identified as both religious and
spiritual had higher rates of participation in HSR programs
during their first year in prison (M = 2.99, SD = 3.98),
compared with spiritual only (M = 1.62, SD = 2.50), religious
only (M = 1.48, SD = 2.05), and neither (M = 0.84, SD = 2.02).”
(346)
“…persons who identified as spiritual only were more than
twice as likely to be rearrested than persons who identified as
religious and spiritual (OR = 2.092, SE = 0.602, p = .009).
Persons who were neither spiritual nor religious, however, did
not have a higher likelihood of recidivism compared with
religious and spiritual people in prison.” (347)"
