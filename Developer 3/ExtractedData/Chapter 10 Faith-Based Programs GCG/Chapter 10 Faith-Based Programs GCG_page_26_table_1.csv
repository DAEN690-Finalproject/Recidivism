Systematic
Review",,,"Faith-based programs
for a criminal justice
population, in prisons
and in the community,
with juveniles and
adults.","1976-2002
1 study

2000 or later

prison-based
program for
adults.",,,"Limited information

criteria.
Selected studies
were rated using the
Maryland Scientific
Methods Scale","7 studies, only 3 of
which dealt with a
prison population.
3 studies were
descriptive with
“methodologically
weak designs”; four
were multivariate
studies which the
reviewers
considered to be “of
strong
methodological
quality.” (379-380)
Of note, none of
these studies were
RCTs.",,,"Based on their review of 4 studies of “strong
methodological quality”, the reviews note: “We
concluded that faith-based programs reviewed
work to reduce recidivism. These findings
should be tempered by the fact that the
research on faith-based programs is limited and
much of the research is methodologically weak.
On the other hand, it would be premature to
abandon faith-based programs. Instead, future
research should use more rigorous research
designs to determine whether faith-based
programs are indeed effective for reducing
criminal behavior.” (381)
With regard to the one post-2000 study, the
researchers noted: “The final study conducted
by Johnson (2002) examined recidivism rates
for two Brazilian prisons. One prison was based
on a vocational model and the other on a faith-
based model. The faith-based prison showed
lower levels of recidivism in the 3-year follow-
up period. In other words, the faith-based
prison model showed long-term treatment
effects. This finding held when controlling for
high-risk as well as low-risk offenders, which is
encouraging.” (381)",,

Review",,,"Studies examining the
relationship between
religion and spirituality

psychometric instruments used and the lack of
methodological standardization, it is not",,
