Self-report measures in
the study included the
Age Universal Religious
Orientation Scale and the
Religious Problem-Solving
Scale. Tracking of HSR
participation was not
based on self-report data
and Oregon DOC’s
recidivism risk calculation
was also included.
Rearrest was used as the
measure of recidivism.",,"High monthly attendance at HSR services in prison was
associated with lower odds of recidivism (OR = 0.936, SE =
0.029).
“Bootstrap estimates suggested that indirect effects via HSR
program participation (95% confidence interval [CI] = [.005,
.032]) and via religious orientation (95% CI = [.010, .045])
were both significant.” (348)"

Subjects were
classified into 4
groups based on
whether they
reported participation
in spiritual activities
and whether they
reported receiving
support from these
activities.","Approximately 70.3% of the women surveyed reported some
participation in religious activities.
“Inmates who received high-level support from participation
in religious activities reported significantly less depression,
recounted perpetrating fewer aggressive acts, and committed
fewer serious institutional infractions than those who did not
attend religious activities as well as those who attended but
reported receiving low-level support. In addition, inmates
reporting a high level of support through their religious
activities reported fewer instances of feeling angry, having
arguments with inmates and correctional officers, physical
fights, and injury than those who reported no participation in
religious activities.” (1)
With respect to the more objective measure of institutional
misconduct: “Inmates who did not indicate religious
participation (M 4.48, SD 5.42) and those who attended but
reported no or little support (M 4.84, SD 5.85) were"
