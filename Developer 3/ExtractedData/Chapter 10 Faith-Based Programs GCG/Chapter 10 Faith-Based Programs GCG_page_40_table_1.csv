surveyed; 386 valid
questionnaires were
returned. Surveys
covered a range of topics,
e.g., family, religious
background, morality,
coping mechanisms, as
well as questions about
the OSL.
The study focused on 268
individuals who
participated in the OSL
event in August 2001 and
considered whether their
participation was related
to the experience of
negative emotions and

measures.","“Descriptive results suggest modest, yet positive, effects of
attendance at the event.” (410)
For example, about 45% of OSL attendees reported they

often since the program as compared to before the program.
More than 1/3 of OSL attendees reported arguing with other
inmates one month before the event and 24% reported doing
so after the event."
