to about 6 meetings per month.
“Controlling for a number of demographic and criminal
history risk factors, logistic regression found an inverse
relationship between intensity of religious involvement and
the presence or absence of in-prison infractions. As religious
involvement increased the number of inmates with
infractions decreased.” (11)
“First, when religious inmates were compared to non-
religious inmates, there was no difference in the propensity
to have infractions. Secondly, when we looked at rates of
participation in religious programming, higher rates were
always associated with less chance of infractions. The more
religious programming sessions an inmate attended, the less
his chance of having infractions.” (25-26)"
