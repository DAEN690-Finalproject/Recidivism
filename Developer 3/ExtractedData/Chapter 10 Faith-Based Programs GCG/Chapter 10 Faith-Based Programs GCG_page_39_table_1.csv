discharge, minimum
sentence, and initial
security classification.
Limitations: Limited
matching on risk-
relevant variables,
lack of clarity in
program content, and
significant self-
selection bias.","“Results from survival analyses indicate: (1) no difference in
median time to rearrest or reincarceration between PF and
non-PF groups throughout the 8-year study period; (2)
participants with higher levels of participation in Bible studies
were less likely to be arrested at 2 and 3 years after release,
though the effect diminishes over time; (3) statistical
differences across groups only border significance at 2 and 3
years for reincarceration; and (4) proportional hazards
modeling shows that high participation in Bible studies
significantly reduces the hazard of rearrest at years 2 and 3.”

Brazilian prisons -
Humaita, the faith-based
prison and Braganca, a
prison focused on
vocational training and

followed 148 individuals
released from Humaita
and 247 individuals
released from Braganca.

offense; sentence start
date, release date, and","1 - Weakly controlled
study lacking
information about
how individuals were
assigned to each
group. In addition,
recidivism data was
not available for 46%
of cases.","Analyses revealed individuals at the two facilities differed in
terms of severity of offense, category of offense, and time
served. According to the researchers, these differences
suggested Humaita subjects would have higher rates of
recidivism.
“The findings reveal that: (1) the three-year recidivism rate of
prisoners from both facilities is extremely low by any standard
(16% Humaita and 36% Braganca), (2) that the recidivism rate
for former Humaita prisoners was significantly lower than
that found for Braganca prisoners, (3) Humaita’s lower
recidivism rate holds among high as well as low-risk prisoners,
(4) inmates from the faith-based prison were charged with
significantly fewer arrests during the three year follow-up
period, and (5) where disposition data were available, former
Braganca prisoners were significantly more likely to be re-
incarcerated than former prisoners from Humaita.” (7)"
