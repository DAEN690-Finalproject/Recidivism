“The data for the current
study were a combination
of official records and
self-reported survey data.
Official records were
used to obtain
information on
misconduct, program
participation, and basic
socio-demographic
information. The self-
reported data asked
study participants about
their religious practices,
attitudes and knowledge
of religion, motivation to
change, and other
relevant factors.” (391)","3 - “The current study

the probability of engaging in serious forms of misconduct. No
effect was discovered, though, for less serious forms of
misconduct or for both types of misconduct considered
simultaneously.” (389)
The researchers note: “There are some more general offenses
among the 300 and 400 levels in the BOP that are not specific
to being in prison, such as gambling and indecent exposure,
but these offenses account for a very small part of the
categories and counts of less-serious offenses. It is possible
that program participation has the perverse effect of raising
the likelihood of receiving a “ticket” for these offenses
because of increased surveillance from program staff and
perhaps even custody staff while in the program.” (392)
“Comparison groups did not differ on the number of prior
misconduct incidents for the three classifications of
misconduct. This is interesting because prior history of
misconduct was not included in the models predicting
propensity for LCP participation.” (392)"
