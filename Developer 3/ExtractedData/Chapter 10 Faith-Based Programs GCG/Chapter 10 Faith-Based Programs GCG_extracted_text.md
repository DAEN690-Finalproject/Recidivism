## FAITH-BASED PROGRAMS

In  this  chapter,  we  review  prison-based  faith-based  programs. The  Federal  Bureau of Prisons (BOP) offers five First Step Act (FSA) approved programs in this category -two programs classified by  the  BOP  as  Evidence-Based  Recidivism  Reduction  (EBRR)  Programs,  and  three  programs classified by the BOP as Productive Activity (PA) Programs. We begin by describing the BOP's faith-based programs, to include the assessment of needs addressed by the programs. We then describe our study identification procedures, provide a review of evaluations conducted both inside  and  outside  of  the  BOP,  compare  BOP  programs  to  evaluated  programs  in  other jurisdictions,  and  offer  an  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  each  BOP  faith-based  program based on our review. We then conclude this chapter with recommendations for future  faithbased programming initiatives.

## 10.1 Overview of Family/Parenting Needs and Faith-Based Programs

The Chaplaincy Services Branch (CSB) in the Reentry Services Division (RSD) is responsible for supporting the delivery of faith-based programs. Chaplaincy Services departments in the BOP are responsible for managing religious activities within the institutions (CSB, 2022). In this context, they provide pastoral care and counseling to incarcerated individuals through group programs and individual services. Per Program Statement 3939.08 Chaplains' Employment, Responsibilities, and  Endorsements ,  BOP  Chaplains are  'employed  to  ensure  the  free  exercise  of  religion  for inmates, lead worship and religious studies out of their own faith tradition, facilitate religious accommodations  across  faith  lines,  offer  pastoral  care,  and  provide faith-based  reentry programming' (C SB, 2023).

All BOP Chaplains are 'qualified pastoral care providers who have verifiable religious credentials and  current  religious  endorsements'  as  outlined  in Program  Statement  3939.08  Chaplains' Employment,  Responsibilities,  and  Endorsements .  BOP  Chaplains  must  possess  a  bachelor's degree  and  a graduate  theological  degree.  In  addition,  they  must  have  professional  ministry experience and a religious endorsement from their own religious endorsing body. Faith-based programs  may  also  be  facilitated  by  contractors  and  volunteers,  as  noted  in  both Program Statement  5300.22  Volunteer  Services and Program  Statement  5360.10  Religious  Beliefs  and Practices (CSB, 2023; CRAB, 2022) .

The BOP s five faith-based programs addressing a range of needs from a faith-based perspective, ' to  include  family/parenting,  cognitions,  antisocial  peers,  and  education.  In  March  2020,

approximately 70% of the BOP's population officially identified with a faith group, with more than 24 different faith traditions or groups represented (Office of the Inspector General, 2021). Faithbased programs offer individuals the opportunity to address needs within the context of their personal faith or value system.

## 10.1.1  Identifying Religious Preferences

Unit Management staff are tasked with entering an initial religious preference assignment into the  BOP's  national  database, SENTRY, at  the  time  of  the  incarcerated  individual's  initial classification (CSB, 2022).  If an individual requests to change their religious preference at a later date, an institution Chaplain is responsible for making the necessary change in SENTRY.  Religious preferences are based solely on self-report.

## 10.1.2  Identifying Family/Parenting Needs

The BOP's faith -based EBRR Programs -the Life Connections and Threshold Programs -address family/parenting needs.  Program Statement 5400.01 First Step Act Needs Assessment indicates Psychology  Services  departments  are responsible  for  assessing  these  needs  during  the  initial intake screening (RSD, 2021). This policy refers staff to Sallyport for additional guidance.

The BOP has adopted the General Functioning Subscale of the McMaster Family Assessment Device  (FAD-12)  to  screen  for  family/parenting  needs.  The  FAD12  is  'a  brief,  stand -alone measure of family functioning…widely used in both research and clinical practice' (BOP, 2022). The FAD-12 evaluates the general pathology of a family with six items on healthy and unhealthy family functioning (Epstein et al., 1983). These family functioning measures consider how the family  communicates,  manages  difficult  situations  and  emotions,  supports  one  another,  and makes  decisions.  The  FAD-12  is  a  selfreport  instrument,  completed  via  the  BOP's  internal computer  system.  As  with  other  self-report  based  needs  assessments,  there  are  issues  with compliance.  According  to  the  BOP's  mo st  recent  needs  assessment  report,  roughly  12%  of individuals did not complete the FAD-12 (BOP, 2022). Of the individuals who did complete the FAD-12, 23% were noted to have a parenting/family need. Higher scores on the FAD-12 indicate greater levels of family dysfunction. The cutoff score for identifying a family/parenting need is not clearly noted in publicly available materials.

## 10.1.3  Identifying Other Relevant Needs

As noted above, faith-based programs also address other need areas: cognitions, antisocial peers, and  education.  Education  Services  and  Psychology  Services  staff  are  responsible  for  needs assessments in these areas, and the specific methods for identifying these additional needs are

detailed  in  other  chapters  of  this  report  -  Chapter  2  for  education  needs  and  Chapter  7  for cognitions  and  antisocial  peers  needs.  As  a  reminder,  the  assessment  of  education  needs  is focused on determining an individual's educational level and potential need for literacy skills and/or English fluency skills. Only one faith-based program is suggested to meet an education need -The Aleph Institute Program. The relationship between the program and education needs currently assessed by the BOP is not clearly indicated. The BOP has adopted the Measures of Criminal Attitudes and Associates (MCAA) to screen for cognitions and antisocial peers needs. For individuals who complete these assessments, 68% present with cognitions needs and 44% present with antisocial peers needs (BOP, 2022).

## 10.2 Faith-Based Program Descriptions

The BOP 's faith-based programs include both residential and non-residential programs. The BOP has classified two faith-based programs as EBRR Programs, and the remaining three faith-based programs as PA Programs. The below table outlines key features of the BOP's five faith -based programs, including the target population, needs addressed, and program dosage. In addition, the table notes the number of institutions offering the program and the number of individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2023. Lastly, the table provides an estimate of the percentage of the target population served by the program to date. Specifically, this estimate compares the total number of program participants and graduates in custody to the total number of individuals in custody with a potential need for such a program. This estimate represents an educated guess, as we did not have access to data allowing for perfect one-to-one comparisons of needs and programs. Following the table, each faith-based program is described in detail.

## Residential Faith-Based Programs

## 10.2.1  Life Connections Program

The Life Connections Program is classified by the BOP as an EBRR Program (BOP, 2022). The program is designed to 'assist inmates in developing their personal/spiritual transformation' as well as to teach practical life skills for a successful return to the community (BOP, 2022). The program was originally implemented in the agency in 2013 as a pilot project. The program is now offered at six institutions serving different geographical locations and security levels, as well as both  males  and  females.  The  program  was  subsequently  expanded  further  by  way  of  a  less intensive,  non-residential  option,  the  Threshold  Program  (see  below).  The  Life  Connections Program relies on various faith communities nationwide who serve as support group facilitators or mentors at program sites and release destinations to enhance community reintegration (BOP, n.d.).

The stated goal of the program is to 'instill values and character through a curriculum of personal, social and moral development' (BOP, n.d.).  Specifically, the program focuses on 'restoration with family, community, self and God' (BOP, n.d.). The target population  for  this  program  is incarcerated individuals with an interest in spiritual development and formation. The program is open to individuals of all faith traditions, including those who do not hold a religious preference. In the institutions, individuals are recruited for the program through Admission and Orientation presentations and via periodic orientation sessions provided by Chapel staff. Given the reentry focus  of  this  program,  participants  typically  must  be  within  24-36  months  of  their  proposed release  date  to  be  considered  for  the  program.  Participants  must  also  comply  with  relevant obligations, e.g., required GED or English-as-a-Second Language enrollment, Financial Responsibility  Program  requirements.  Individuals  are  transferred  for  participation  in  the program. To apply for the program, individuals must complete the Life Connections Program

orientation  workbook,  A  New  Direction,  and  view  the  3-session  Life  Connections  Program orientation video. They must also complete an interview with their local Chaplain. The Chaplain then generates a referral packet and a request to transfer the individual to a Life Connections Program institution. Per the BOP, the program addresses family/parenting needs.

The Life Connections Program is a residential, faith-based reentry program.  The program is a 500-hour, 18month program staged at the end of an individual's sentence (BOP, n.d.). Prior to beginning  the  program,  individuals  complete  two  assessments -the  Spiritual  Development Survey and the Survey of Attitudes and Behavior; these assessments are administered to measure and track the effectiveness of the program. Individuals enter the program in cohorts of 36, or fewer, individuals, with new cohorts beginning every 6 months. The curriculum includes five days of regularly scheduled afternoon and evening programming, as well as weekend activities. The program consists of two tracks -a secular track and a spirituality track.

Components of the secular track are: 'opportunities to develop and adopt a code of ethics and morality; creating and establishing decision-making strategies consistent with personal code of conduct; participating in scheduled institution-sponsored value-based programs; opportunities for reflection (whether secular or religious), direction, and counseling; and using journals and personal reflection to develop personal growth' ( CSB, 2013). Components of the spirituality track are: 'opportunities  for  spiritual reflection (whether  secular  or  religious), direction, and counseling;  opportunities  to  develop  and  adopt  a  code  of  ethics  and  morality;  creating  and establishing decision-making strategies consistent with personal code of conduct; participating in institution worship services consistent with boundaries of faith or secular beliefs; and using journals  and  personal  reflection  to  develop  spiritual  growth'  ( CSB,  2013).  In  addition,  all participants also complete the following program components: education, community mentoring, community service (i.e., community service), and victim impact, to include interaction with Victim Impact Panels.

Mentoring is a significant component of the program as well, both while incarcerated and upon release.  Participants  are  initially  connected  with  community  mentors  while  incarcerated,  and these mentors meet with participants to reflect on issues, model appropriate social behaviors, and develop a maintenance plan for living upon reentry (CSB, 2013). Participants are also linked to  a  mentoring  organization  at  their  release  destination.  Ongoing  correspondence  with  the mentoring  organization  is  encouraged,  and  if  possible,  a  visit  by  a  representative  of  the organization prior to the individual's release. Through its mentoring component, the program seeks to strengthen 'participants understanding of what it means to live and work effectively in the community' (BOP , 2022).

The Life Connections Program is staffed by a dedicated Life Connections Program Chaplain, and supported  by  mentor  coordinators,  contracted  spiritual  guides,  community  mentors,  and volunteers  (CSB,  2013).  The  Chaplain  significantly  assists  participants  in  formulating  personal goals reflecting 'outcome based objectives.' The program is described in policy, in Operations Memorandum  003-2013  (5325)  Life Connections Program (CSB, 2013). The Operations Memorandum expired on April 23, 2014, and at present the program has not been incorporated into a Program Statement. Consequently, there are no Program Review Guidelines in place to ensure program fidelity. Successful completion of the program is based on achieving program goals, and outcome measures are included in the program via re-administering of the Spiritual Development  Survey  and  the  Survey  of  Attitudes  and  Behavior.  The  anticipated  program outcomes are a reduction in misconduct, improved institutional adjustment, acquisition of daily living skills, and a reduction in recidivism risk.

In  the  BOP's  FSA  Approved  Programs  Guide,  the  Life  Connections  Program  is  described  as available at 6 institutions, two female institutions and four male institutions - FCI Aliceville, AL, FMC Carswell, TX; USP Leavenworth, KS; FCI Milan, MI; FCI Petersburg, VA; USP Terre Haute, IN; however, at the close of FY 2023, the program was offered at only 5 institutions (BOP, 2023). The program was not operational at USP Leavenworth, KS; a plan is in place to reopen the program at  FCI  Greenville,  IL  in  late  2023.  In  calendar  year 2021,  221  individuals  were  enrolled  in  the program and 155 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 366 individuals participating in the program, down from 371 individual participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022).  At present, 2.96% of the BOP population with a family/parenting need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## Nonresidential Faith-Based Programs

## 10.2.2  Threshold Program

The  Threshold  Program  is  also  classified  by  the  BOP  as  an  EBRR  Program  (BOP,  2022).    As  a condensed version  of  the  Life  Connections  Program,  the  spiritual  and  values-based  program shares many similarities with this program in terms of goals, core curriculum, and the use of mentoring. Primary differences between the two programs are the Threshold Program is offered in a nonresidential setting, and the program delivered over 6-9 months as opposed to 18 months. Like  the  Life  Connections  Program,  the  target  population  is  incarcerated  individuals  with  an interest  in  spiritual  development  and  formation;  however, this  program is made available to individuals who are ineligible for the Life Connections Program or unwilling to transfer to a Life Connections Program institution. Given the reentry focus of this program, participants typically

must be within 24 months of their proposed release date to be considered for the program. Individuals volunteer for the program based on a family/parenting need which they would like to address in a faith-based context.

Prior to entering the program, individuals complete the same preliminary assessments as in the Life Connections Program: the Spiritual Development Survey and the Survey of Attitudes and Behavior,  with  the  same  goal  of  measuring  and  tracking  the  effectiveness  of  the  program. Typically,  participants  meet  weekly  for  90-minute  small  group  sessions,  i.e.,  20  or  fewer participants.  Completion  of  the  program  requires  approximately  72  hours.  The  curriculum  is provided via a facilitator guide and a series of interactive journals developed by The Change Companies. Guidance provided by the Chaplaincy Services Branch indicates individuals should 'prayerfully commit to the program prior to issuing a full set of curriculum,' i.e., the interactive journals (CSB, n.d.). There is some flexibility in the program, in that Chaplains are encouraged to 'utilize  various  teaching  methods  and  supplement the curriculum with exercises to keep the leaders and participants engaged and committed' ( CSB, n.d.). Chaplains are also provided with different  models  for  implementing  the  program,  i.e.,  small  group,  large  group,  workshop  or retreat, one-on-one model (CSB, n.d.).

Unlike  the  Life  Connections  Program,  the  Threshold  Program  does  not  have  dedicated  staff facilitators. The program is facilitated by leadership in Chaplaincy Services or by appropriately credentialed  religious  community  volunteers,  contractors,  or  mentors.  The  program  is  not explicitly described  in  BOP  policy.  The Operations  Memorandum,  003-2013  (5325),  Life Connections Program , does briefly describe components of the Life Connections Program, upon which the Threshold Program is based. However, there are no Program Review Guidelines in place to ensure program fidelity. Successful completion of the program is  based on achieving program goals, and outcome measures are included in the program via re-administration of the Spiritual  Development  Survey  and  the  Survey  of  Attitudes  and  Behavior.  The  program's anticipated  outcomes  are  a  reduction  in  misconduct,  improved  institutional  adjustment, acquisition of life skills, and a reduction in recidivism risk.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Threshold Program is described as available at all  institutions; however, at the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 108 institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, 1,190 individuals were enrolled in the program and 1,334 individuals  completed  the  program  (BJS,  2022).  At  the  close  of  FY  2023,  there  were  2,850 individuals participating in the program, up significantly from 1,790 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 35.57% of the BOP population  with  a  family/parenting  need  either  (1)  are  enrolled  in  the  program  or  (2)  have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023). It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 10.2.3  Houses of Healing Program

The  Houses  of  Healing  Program  is  classified  by  the  BOP  as  a  PA  Program  designed  to  teach emotional literacy skills  (BOP,  2022).  Per  the  BOP (2022),  'emotional  literacy  is  the  ability  to perceive, understand, and communicate emotions with self and to others'. The program was developed by Robyn Casarjian in 1995 and is detailed in her book of the same name. The target population  for  this  program  is  incarcerated  individuals  with  an  interest  in  addressing  their personal challenges in a faith-based context. The stated goal of the program is to address 'the emotional, social, behavioral, and spiritual growth  and development of those involved in the criminal justice system' (The Lionheart Foundation, n.d.). As noted above, the need addressed in this program is cognitions (BOP, 2022).

The  Houses  of  Healing  Program  is  a  13-session,  24-hour  program  consisting  of  a  traumainformed,  mindfulness-based,  cognitive-behavioral  curriculum.  Program  modules  address  the following  topic  areas:    early  childhood  trauma  and  the  legacies  of  intergenerational  abuse, incarceration,  and  substance  use.  The  program  encourages  personal  responsibility  as  well  as forgiveness  of  self  and  others.  Per  the  Lionheart  Foundation's  website  (n.d.),  the  curriculum provides participants the opportunity to 'practice mindful ness meditation, emotional-regulation, and  stress-management  techniques;  learn  cognitive-behavioral  skills  to  reframe  challenging situations and alter life-long patterns of violence and addiction; acknowledge, work with, and heal childhood trauma; transform anger, resentment, and unhealthy guilt and shame; work with and adopt forgiveness as a practical strategy; explore and heal grief; acknowledge the impact of crime,  build  victim  awareness,  and  take  responsibility  for  offending  behavior;  and  nurture spirit ual growth'.

The topics for each of the 13 sessions are: (1) introduction and who are you, really? (2) forgiving on neutral territory and relaxation, (3) reframing and meditation, (4) sub-personalities and the emotional weather report, (5) anger and resentment: part 1, (6) anger and resentment: part 2, (7)  from  childhood  to  prison:  the  long  and  winding  road,  (8)  the  fallout  from  childhood wounding…and how to start recovery, (9) restoring dignity: facing guilt, shame, and the impact of crime, (10) closure, apology, and self-forgiveness, (11) self-forgiveness and grief, (12) forgiving others, and (13) moving on: creating our futures. Resources for the Houses of Healing Program include the book, Houses of Healing: A Prisoner's Guide to Inner Power and Freedom, as well as the Houses of Healing Facilitator Manual (Casarjian, 1995; Casarjian, 2000) A supplemental DVD series is also available to assist with program delivery and facilitators are encouraged to utilize this resource.  The materials are available on The Lionheart Foundation website.

The  program  does  not  have  a  dedicated  staff  facilitator.    According  to  the  BOP  (2022),  the program  may  be  facilitated  by  chaplains,  contractors,  or  volunteers.  A  brief  implementation

guide is made available on Sallyport (Kugler &amp; Lee, n.d.). The program is not explicitly described in BOP policy and there are no specific Program Review Guidelines associated with the program. Successful completion of the program is based on attendance, participation, and completion of a brief 3-question survey at the close of the program. The survey requires participants to share their expectations of the program, what they learned by the 6 th session, and how they will apply what  they  have  learned.  The  pr ogram's  anticipated  outcome  is  the  acquisition  of  stress management  and  coping  skills  and  the  development  of  empathy,  emotional  maturity,  and spiritual healing.

In  the  BOP's  FSA  Approved  Programs  Guide,  the  Houses  of  Healing  Program  is  described  as available  at  all  institutions;  however,  at  the  close  of  FY  2023  the  program  was  offered  at  74 institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, 389 individuals were enrolled in the program and 631 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 823 individuals participating in the program, down from 865 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 8.05% of the BOP population with a cognitions need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 10.2.4  Embracing Interfaith Cooperation Program

The Embracing Interfaith Cooperation Program is classified by the BOP as a PA Program fostering 'interfaith  dialogue,  discussion  and  understanding'  (BOP,  2022).  The  program  is  designed  to encourage  and  support  religious  tolerance.  The  program  was  developed  by  Eboo  Patel,  a sociologist and president of Interfaith America (Interfaith America, n.d.). The stated goal of the program  is  to  'provide  an  effective  strategy  in  countering  religious  discrimination  and extremism' (BOP, 2022).  The target population for this program is individuals with a cognitions need and a desire to address this need in a spiritual context.

The  Embracing  Interfaith  Cooperation  Program  is  a  10-hour,  5-session  educational  course 'breaking down stereotypes and barriers for people and communities to serve together toward meeting  common civil  rights  and  community  goals'  (BOP,  2022).  The  course  is facilitated  by viewing and discussing video vignettes of interfaith conversations.  The vignettes depict small group discussions with representative from various faith traditions, i.e., a Jew, two Muslims, a spiritual seeker with Jain and Hindu roots, two Episcopal Christians, and one Evangelical Christian who is working in the Lutheran Church (Patel, 2013).

Program  modules  address  the  following  topic  areas:  (1)  interfaith  cooperation  in  American history, (2) interfaith literacy, (3) the science of interfaith cooperation, (4) the art of interfaith

leadership, and (5) the role of colleges, seminaries and houses of worship (Patel, 2013). The curriculum includes 'stories of American founders and great leaders who believed and acted on the principle that it is possible to embrace differences in religiou s and maintain a common life' (CSB , n.d.).  Per the developer, 'each session opens with five activities for participants to consider as preparation for the session, closes with a blessing from one of the faith traditions that is named in  the  video  conversation,  and  ends  with  one  reflective  activity  as  a  suggestion  for  ongoing engagement with the topic of the session' (Patel, 2013). Resources for the program include the participant  workbook Embracing  Interfaith  Cooperation:  Eboo  Patel  on  Coming  Together  to Change the World by Eboo Patel and the above referenced DVD of 10 -15-minute video vignettes for  each  module,  made  available  on  the  Church  Publishing  Incorporated  website  (Church Publishing Incorporated, n.d.).

The  program  does  not  have  a  dedicated  staff  facilitator.  According  to  the  BOP  (2022),  the program  may  be  facilitated  by  chaplains,  contractors,  or  volunteers.  A  brief  implementation guide is made available on Sallyport (Kugler &amp; Lee, n.d.). The program is not explicitly described in BOP policy and there are no specific Program Review Guidelines associated with the program. Successful completion of the program is based on attendance, participation, and completion of a brief 3-question survey at the close of the program.  The survey requires participants to share their expectations of the program, what they learned by the 3rd session, and how they will apply what they have learned. The program's anticipated outcome is a greater interfaith literacy, as well as a reduction in discrimination and religious extremism.  It is not clear how the program explicitly addresses cognitions needs.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Embracing Interfaith Cooperation Program is described  as  available  at  all  institutions;  however,  at  the  close  of  FY  2023  the  program  was offered at 30 institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, 216 individuals were enrolled in the program and 470 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 345 individuals participating in the program, up from 275 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 6.82% of the BOP population with a cognitions need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023). It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 10.2.5  Aleph Institute Program

The Aleph Institute Program is a correspondence course classified by the BOP as a PA Program (BOP, 2022).  The program, termed 'Sparks of Light', was developed by the Aleph Institute. The Aleph  Institute  is  a  'non -profit  Jewish  organization  dedicated  to  assisting  and  caring  for  the wellbeing of members of special populations that are isolated from the regular community:  U.S.

military  personnel,  prisoners,  and  people  institutionalized  or  at  risk  of  incarceration  due  to mental illness or addictions' (Aleph Institute, n.d.). Individuals are self -referred to the program; they  contact  the  Aleph  Institute  directly  for  further  information  regarding  the  program application  and  admission  process.  The  target  population  for  the  program  is  incarcerated individuals of the Jewish faith, or individuals interested in learning more about the Jewish faith. Needs addressed in the program include cognitions, antisocial peers, and education, although the link between the program and these specific needs is not clearly articulated.

The Aleph Institute Program, Sparks of Light, 'offers a wide array of learner -friendly materials from a Hebrew Reading and Writing Course to the mystical teachings of the Kabbalah' (BOP, 2022). Individuals may choose from a slate of more than 32 courses on a wide range of topics, e.g.,  Hebrew  reading  and  writing,  Rambam,  Jewish  Law,  Kabbalah,  prayer,  Shabbos,  and Chassidus  (Aleph  Institute,  n.d.).  According  to  Rabbi  Yossi  Cohen  of  the  Aleph  Institute,  the courses 'reflect and address issues relating towards combating recidivism and being a productive member of society' (Holt, 2022). Per the BOP (2022), the course requires approximately 50 hours to complete over the course of one year.

As a correspondence course, there is no direct program facilitation; however, volunteers from the Aleph Institute may assist program participants. In addition, the Aleph Institute website notes additional support is available in the form of MP3 files and the 'Torah on the Phone' initiative. The program is not explicitly described in BOP policy and there are no specific Program Review Guidelines associated with the program.  Volunteer Services are generally referenced in Program Statement 5300.22 Volunteer Services ; however, no specific discussion of this program is noted. Criteria  for  successful  completion  of  the  program  are  not  readily  available.  The  anticipated outcome of the program is enhanced spiritual growth. As noted above, it is not clear how the program explicitly addresses cognitions, antisocial peers, and education needs.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Aleph Institute Program is described as available at all institutions; however, at the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 61 institutions (BOP,  2023).  In  calendar  year  2021,  no  individuals  were  enrolled  in  the  program  and  no individuals  completed  the  program  (BJS,  2022).  At  the  close  of  FY  2023,  there  were  363 individuals participating in the program, up significantly from 55 individuals participating in the program  at  the  close  of  FY  2022  (BOP,  2023;  BOP,  2022).  At  present,  15.43%  of  the  BOP population who identify as Jewish either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not  clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 10.3 Study Identification Procedures

To  create  our  study  database,  we  first  examined  all  published  meta-analyses  and  systematic reviews published during our review period (2000-present). Based on this search, we identified four  meta-analyses  and  systematic  reviews  of  the  empirical  literature  on  faith,  religion,  and spirituality in correctional settings (see Appendix Table 10A for an overview). As noted in Chapter 1, a strong argument can be made evaluations of prison-based faith-based programs operating in the 1990's and earlier are not relevant today, because of changes over time in program design components and incarcerated populations. Our review of these meta-analyses and systematic reviews did reveal several studies conducted since 2000; we included these studies in our review.

The next step in our study identification process was to determine whether these meta-analyses and  systematic  reviews  perhaps  missed  relevant  evaluations  due  to  the  search  procedures employed; or excluded them from their review due to their study inclusion criteria. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic search of the following electronic databases:

- · APA PsycINFO
- · Academic Search Premier
- · Criminal Justice Abstracts
- · MEDLINE
- · JSTOR
- · Education Research Complete
- · ScienceDirect
- · Springer Nature Journals
- · Political Science Complete

We used the following specific terms for our systematic search of electronic databases:

(faith or religion OR spirituality) AND (prison OR jail OR incarceration OR imprisonment OR correction facilities) AND (recidivism OR reoffending OR repeat offenders)

Specific  faithbased  programs  were  also  keyed  into  the  database  search  replacing  'faith  or religion  or  spirituality',  including  'Life  Connections  Program',  'Threshold  Program',  'Aleph Institute', 'Embracing Interfaith Cooperation', and 'Houses of Healing'. The inclusion of 'Life Connections Program' yielded 2 new hits, while the remaining program names produced 0 new hits.

This search initially yielded 110 hits, but that number was reduced to 90 studies due to duplicates across the databases. Visual inspection of the titles and abstracts by the research team further

reduced the number of potential studies to 27 requiring in-depth review. Based on our in-depth review of the studies identified in the meta-analysis, systematic reviews, and from our search of the  literature, we  have  identified  19  studies  on  the  effect  of  prison-based  faith-based programming, which we include in our final sample. Summaries of these 19 studies are provided in Appendix Table 10B.

## 10.4 Evaluations of Faith-Based Programs in the BOP

Our review of recent evaluation research (2000-2022) related to faith-based programs offered in the  BOP identified  only  one  study:  Camp  et  al.'s  2008  evaluation  of  BOP's  Life  Connections Program,  an  18-month  residential  treatment  program  that  includes  a  moral  component encouraging pro-social values, a cognitive behavioral component targeting criminal thinking, and social support component using mentors to assist reentry to the community (Camp et al., 2008). The  level  3  quasi-experimental  evaluation  (see  Appendix  Table  10B  for  details)  compared participants in the Life Connections Program 1 at 5 facilities to a post hoc comparison group of federal prisoners held at 13 facilities that did not offer the program; researchers used propensity score matching to select the comparison group 2 . The evaluation provided information on the impact of the Life Connections Program on prison misconduct; the study did not measure any other potential in-prison changes in participants (e.g., criminal thinking, attitudes, religiosity).

According  to  the  research  team,  the  results  of  this  evaluation  provide  preliminary  evidence linking  program  participation  to  a  statistically  significant,  but  small  reduction  in  serious misconduct  (5%  LCP  vs.  11%  control,  a  6%  difference),  but  no  differences  for  either  overall misconduct (19% vs.  23%),  or  minor  misconduct  (16%  LCP  vs  15%  control).  Their  concluding comments are worth considering here:

'Do these findings indicate that faith -based programs work? This is a very good question, but one that  is  not  yet  answered  satisfactorily.  On  a  single  dimension,  albeit  an  important  one, participating in a faith-based program reduced serious misconduct during the program, but lessserious misconduct was apparently left unchanged' (2008, 394).

Given the size and scope of this evaluation, we are surprised that BOP researchers did not also examine the effects of this program on other in-prison outcomes and/or post-release outcomes. We recognize that an internal evaluation of the potential recidivism reduction effects of this

program may indeed have been conducted, but not released for public review. However, we have only examined the publicly available, published BOP evaluation in this review, because the results of  an  internal  evaluation  of  the  program's  recidivism  reduction  effects  was  not  available  for review 3 .  Based  on  the  available  evaluation,  we  rate  the  in-prison  effects  of  this  program  as promising ,  but only if reductions in serious misconduct are the outcome of interest; the postrelease recidivism reduction effects of this program are currently unknown .

Despite the lack of internal evaluation support, two of the faith-based programs offered by the BOP are currently classified as EBRR Programs: the above-mentioned Life Connections Program and the Threshold Program. These two programs vary in intensity (i.e., Life Connections is a 500hour program; Threshold is a 72-hour program), and availability (Life Connections is available in 5 prisons; Threshold is available in 108 prisons). BOP -with NIJ funding support--has recently contracted with the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) and the Urban Institute to evaluate both the Life Connections and Threshold Programs.  The results of these two program evaluations will allow BOP to compare the effectiveness of faith-based programs of varying intensity, both in terms of in-prison effects and post-release recidivism reduction.

Details of the research designs to be employed in both evaluations were not available for review, but internal documents provided by the BOP reveal that the evaluation was initiated at the end of FY 2022, and it has an anticipated completion date in FY 2027. Both in-prison effects (e.g., reduction in mental health crises, fewer disciplinary actions) and post-release outcomes (e.g., recidivism) will be evaluated. In the interim, we will base our classification of these programs on a review of the evaluation research conducted outside of BOP. We review this body of research in the following section.

One final note on the evaluation of faith-based programs in the BOP. The BOP has recently added a new Faith-based program: Faith-based Conflict Management, which they have classified as an EBRR Program. Since this program was added after the start of our review, we were not asked to review it. However, BOP has indicated that it has plans to fund an external evaluation of this new

program, with an anticipated award in FY 2026. BOP does not plan to evaluate the three faithbased programs they currently classify as PA Programs.

## 10.5 Evaluations of Faith-Based Programs Outside BOP

In this section, we review the body of recent research (2000-2022) related to the evaluation of faith-based  programs  outside  the  BOP.  We  begin  by  summarizing  the  results  of  available systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the effects of faith-based programs on in-prison and post-release outcomes.

Appendix  Table  10A  presents  the  results  of  three  systematic  reviews  of  faith-based  based programs conducted during our review period (Dodson et al., 2011; Eytan ,2011; and Volokh, 2011), along with one meta-analysis of the in-prison effects of these programs on attitudes and misconduct (Schaefer et al., 2016).

The Dodson et al. (2011) review included seven studies;  three of the seven studies examined prison programs; only one study was published post 2000 (Johnson, 2002), and this study had serious  research  design  flaws  (see  our  review  and  ranking  in  Appendix  Table  10B).  They concluded that 'the research on faith-based programs is limited and much of the research is methodologically  weak '  (2011,  381) but  offered  that  their  review  suggests  that 'faith -based programs…work to reduce recidivism' (2011, 381) .

Volokh  (2011)  reviewed  19  evaluations  of  faith-based  programs,  including  seven  studies published post 2000 4 , and reached a similar conclusion about the lack of high-quality evaluation research on faith-based programs, while noting that 'no study actually finds a significant effect of an in-prison faithbased program on recidivism' (2011,90).

Schaefer  et  al.'s  2011  meta -analysis  examined  faith  practices  and  the  impact  of  voluntary participation  in  faith  education,  bible  study,  spiritual  counseling,  and  worship  services  on selected  in-prison  outcomes.  Only  5  of  the  15  studies  included  in  this  meta-analysis  were

conducted post 2000 5 . Schaefer and colleagues' analyses revealed significant, but small effects of faith-based program participation on in-prison attitudes and behaviors, while noting larger effects for the small number of faith-based programs with a mentoring component. They also found that ' those faith-based programs that are based on and implemented in accordance with theories of offender rehabilitation produce larger reductions in antisocial attitudes and inmate misconduct ' (2016, 612) . However, they cautioned that 'The effect of faith-based interventions may not result in long-term behavioral change, and our findings may reflect only a temporary inmate adjustment ' (2016, 615) .

Finally, Eytan (2011) conducted a systematic review of studies examining religion and spirituality that  included  18  studies  (12  quantitative,  6  qualitative),  but  only  3  of  these  studies  were published post 2000 and focused on prison-based programs. This review included research on the effects of religion and spirituality on the mental health of individuals in incarceration settings; it was not a review of research on the effectiveness of specific faith-based programs. Eytan (2011, 289)  concluded  tha t 'religion  and  spirituality [RS]  was  shown  to  improve  coping,  reduce depressive symptoms or self-harm in five studies. In 6 studies, RS had an impact on inmates' behaviour by reducing arguments, violence and disciplinary sanctions. '

The four reviews we just highlighted suggest that faith-based programs may have positive inprison effects that are important to consider, including improvements in coping skills, attitudes, and institutional behavior. These reviews offer very little evidence of post-release outcomes of participation in faith-based programs.

Appendix  Table  10B  includes  the  results  of  18  evaluations  of  faith-based  prison  programs conducted between 2000 and 2022. We have also included the Camp et al. 2008 study of BOP's Life Connections Program for comparative purposes. We have classified 7 of these 18 evaluations as level 3 studies. Only two of these studies provide information on in-prison outcomes. Duwe et al. (2015) reported significant, and large reductions in overall and major misconduct incidents for 158 participants in a Texas prison Bible college (BC) program when compared to a matched group of 222 nonparticipants: ' For minor misconduct, 47% of the comparison group had a discipline conviction compared to 19% of the BC participants. The rate of major misconduct for comparison group offenders (28%) was more than four times higher than it was for BC participants (6%) '

(2015,  384).  However,  researchers  pointed  out  that  this  program  had  both  an  educational component and a faith-based/spiritual component, and that one alternate explanation for the positive inprison findings is that ' the prosocial outcomes might have been due mostly to the educational and/or other influences than the faith component of the program ' (2015, 387) .

The second faith-based prison program evaluation providing intermediate, in-prison outcomes was Gerace and Day's 2010 evaluation of a n intensive but short 3 ½ day Christian religious course using a variety of group-based and meditation techniques to address criminal thinking, empathy, and readiness for change. Thirty-eight (38) males in a medium security prison in Australia were randomly  assigned  to  treatment  and  control  groups,  and  several different assessment instruments  were  administered  at  both  the  pre-test  and  post-test  stage,  including  the Psychological Inventory of  Criminal Thinking Styles, Interpersonal Reactivity  Index, Treatment Readiness  Questionnaire,  and  the  Forgiveness  of  Self  and  Forgiveness  of  Others  Scale.  No statistically  pre-post  differences  between  groups  on  these  indices  were  identified,  but  small sample size was mentioned by researchers as a partial explanation for the 'no effect' finding.

Based on these two studies, we rate the in-prison effects of faith-based programs as mixed.

Five of the level 3 studies included in Appendix Table 10B reported post-release outcomes.  Two of  these  studies  reported  that  faith-based  program  participants  had  lower  recidivism  than comparison groups of non-participants 6 (Duwe &amp; King, 2013; Cannonier et al., 2013), one study reported  positive  recidivism  reduction  effects,  but  only  for  participants  who  completed  the program ( Johnson &amp; Larson, 2003), one study reported mixed effects with one of two different faith-based models having a recidivism reduction effect (Florida Legislature, 2009); and one study reported no difference between treatment and control groups (Brazell &amp; Lavigne, 2008).

Overall, we classify these results as mixed .

However, it may be more accurate to state that the five faith-based programs under review offer five very different program models. We highlight these different models in Appendix Table 10B.

For example, Duwe &amp; King (2013) evaluated Minnesota's InnerChange Program, which is based on a therapeutic community (TC) model. It is a highly structured 18-month in-prison program with a 12-month aftercare component. The Tennessee Men of Valor (MOV) Program evaluated by  Cannonier  et  al.  (2021)  is  essentially  a  faith-based  reentry  support  program  that  targets individuals within six months of release and then provides the opportunity for participants to participate in one of two different community-based residential aftercare programs. Duwe et al.'s 2015 evaluation of a Texas Bible College program looks very different than the previous two programs;  it  combines  education  with  a  spiritual  component,  and  it  is  prison-based  with  no aftercare  component.  The  2 0009  evaluation  of  Florida's  two  faith -based  prison  programs represents a fourth variation on the faith-based program model. One model being evaluated was tested in three faith and character-based institutions, with results varying by location; the other model being tested focused on faith and character-based dorms; no effects were found for this model.  Because of these model-specific differences, it does seem appropriate to classify the two faith-based  program  models  showing  significant  recidivism  reduction  effects, Minnesota's InnerChange program and Tennessee's MOV program as promising .

As  noted  above,  the  BOP  has  not  evaluated  the  three  faith-based  programs  classified  as  PA Programs, nor did we identify any studies meeting our review criteria which evaluated these programs. We did identify two level 1 evaluations of the Houses of Healing Program, but these studies  did  not  meet  our  review  criteria.  Without  additional  information  on  each  of  these programs, we are unable to offer an assessment of their effectiveness, i.e., unknown .

## 10.6 Faith-Based Programs Comparability Assessment

In this section, we compare the BOP 's faith-based programs to evaluated faith-based programs. Unlike many of the other programs under our review, the Life Connections Program has been directly evaluated in the BOP. The program, as evaluated in the Camp et al. (2008) study, appears very  comparable  to  today's  Life  Connections  Program,  with  no  substantive  changes  in  the program's target population, referral methods, content, dosage, and staffing noted. However, a single study is not sufficient to support our evaluation of the program's EBRR classification, so we turn to evaluations in other jurisdictions.

Based  on  our  review,  Minnesota's  InnerChange  Program  as  evaluated  by  Duwe  et  al. (2015) appears comparable to the BOP's Life Connections Program. The InnerChange Program seeks to promote  positive  values  and  address  criminogenic  needs,  not  unlike  the  Life  Connections Program. While the program does promote Christianity, the program is open to both Christians and non-Christians, consistent with the interfaith model of the Life Connections Program. The InnerChange  Program  identifies  community-based  mentors  for  each  participant  and  stresses linking releasing individuals to a faith group in their community, as does the Life Connections

Program. Both programs are offered in a residential setting, with a duration of at least 18 months. For  these  reasons,  we  consider  the  BOP's  Life  Connections  Program  to  be  comparable  to evaluated programs.

Although the BOP's Threshold Program shares similarities with the above two programs, the Threshold Program omits a significant component - a residential treatment model. The program is also of a significantly shorter duration, such that we do not find it to be comparable to the faith-based programs identified in our review.

We  did  identify  two  studies  of  the  Houses  of  Healing  Program,  but  the  methodological weaknesses  of  these  studies  did  not  support  their  inclusion  in  our  review.  Consequently,  a comparability analysis is not required. See Appendix Table 10B for an overview of these studies: Casarjian (2012) and Ferszt et al. (2009).

The  remaining  two  PA  Programs  -  the  Embracing  Interfaith  Cooperation  and  Aleph  Institute Programs  -  were  not  comparable  to  any  programs  identified  in  our  review  of  faith-based programs.

## 10.7 Faith-Based Programs Recommendations

In  addition  to  conducting  a  review  of  the  evaluation  research  and  offering  an  assessment  of whether specific programs should be designated as either EBRR Programs or PA Programs, the Global Corrections Group is tasked with 'informing future First Step Act program updates/revisions'. To this end, we offer the following recommendations.

A significant problem with both the Life Connections and Threshold Programs is the lack of policy support for these programs. Despite the fact the Life Connections Program has been in operation for more than 15 years, it is not described in any current policy. An Operations Memorandum outlining the program in very general terms expired more than a decade ago. If this program, and the Threshold Program, remain in the BOP's programming portfolio every effort should be made to draft and issue policy in support of the programs. While the CSB's ability to achieve high levels of program availability and participation absent policy is impressive, program fidelity cannot be assured absent policy and Program Review Guidelines.

A  further  concern  with  the  BOP's  faith -based  programs  is  a  lack  of  connection  between  the programs and the needs they are identified as addressing. For example, the Life Connections and Threshold  Programs  are  identified  as  addressing  a  family/parenting  need;  however,  family dysfunction does not appear to be a prerequisite for admission to these programs. In addition, the scope  of these programs  appears  broader,  i.e., not  focused exclusively on  family

relationships. As another example,  the Aleph Institute Program is noted to address antisocial peers,  cognitions,  and  education  needs.  However,  the  Aleph  Institute  Program  is  primarily  a correspondence course teaching participants the tenets of the Jewish faith. The program does not appear to directly address these needs, as they are typically identified and addressed in the criminal  justice  literature.  The  BOP  should  more  clearly  articulate  how  these  programs  are expected  to  address  identified  needs;  this  recommendation  applies  to  all  the  faith-based programs, and to programs in several other categories as well.

Another issue with the BOP's faith -based programs is the targeting of specific faith groups in some FSA-approved programs. Programs primarily for individuals of Jewish (i.e., Aleph Institute Program) and Christian (i.e., Houses of Healing Program)  faiths are included, but other faithspecific groups are not represented among the program selections. In our view, either all FSA approved programs should be interfaith programs, or the diversity of faith groups found in the BOP should be better represented. In addition, the rationale for identifying only a portion of religious activities as PA Programs is unclear. For example, our review of faith-based programs included a Bible study program (Duwe et al., 2015), which BOP Chaplaincy Services departments certainly  offer.  Many  would  likely  consider  studies  of  the  Bible,  Koran,  etc.  to  be  productive activities as defined in the FSA, but by and large the BOP does not identify them as such.

As noted above , the BOP's most intensive faith -based programs - the Life Connections Program and the Threshold Program are currently being evaluated. This research effort will aid the BOP in determining whether these programs add value to their FSA programming portfolio.

## 10.8 Summary of Results

Two of the BOP's faith -based programs examined in this report are currently classified by the BOP as EBRR Programs. Based on our review of the evaluation research conducted on these programs published between 2000 and 2022, we find support for provisionally classifying the Life Connections  Program  as  an  EBRR  Program,  based  on promising support  for  its  impact  on intermediate  in-prison  outcomes,  and  similarly promising support  for  the  impact  of  the comparable  InnerChange  Program  in  Minnesota.  We  did  not  find  support  for  continued classification of the Threshold Program as an EBRR Program; the BOP's ongoing research effort should inform the future classification of this program as an EBRR Program.

We were also asked to assess the remaining three programs, which are currently classified as PA Programs -the  Houses  of  Healing,  Embracing  Interfaith  Cooperation,  and  Aleph  Institute Programs.  For  these  programs,  our  review  did  not  find  sufficient  research  to  make  any determination about their PA Program designation. Once again, the necessary research with a correctional population has not been conducted.

The table below provides a summary of the results of our research review.

| Dodson et al.  (2011)  Systematic  Review | Faith-based programs  for a criminal justice  population, in prisons  and in the community,  with juveniles and  adults. | 1976-2002  1 study  published in  2000 or later  dealt with a  prison-based  program for  adults. | Limited information  provided about  study selection  criteria.  Selected studies  were rated using the  Maryland Scientific  Methods Scale | 7 studies, only 3 of  which dealt with a  prison population.  3 studies were  descriptive with  'methodologically  weak designs'; four  were multivariate  studies which the  reviewers  considered to be 'of  strong  methodological  quality.' (379 -380)  Of note, none of  these studies were  RCTs. | Based on their review of 4 studies of 'strong  methodological quality', the reviews note: 'We  concluded that faith-based programs reviewed  work to reduce recidivism. These findings  should be tempered by the fact that the  research on faith-based programs is limited and  much of the research is methodologically weak.  On the other hand, it would be premature to  abandon faith-based programs. Instead, future  research should use more rigorous research  designs to determine whether faith-based  programs are indeed effective for reducing  criminal behavior.' (381) With regard to the one post-2000 study, the  researchers noted: 'The final study conducted  by Johnson (2002) examined recidivism rates  for two Brazilian prisons. One prison was based  on a vocational model and the other on a faith- based model. The faith-based prison showed  lower levels of recidivism in the 3-year follow- up period. In other words, the faith-based  prison model showed long-term treatment  effects. This finding held when controlling for  high-risk as well as low-risk offenders, which is  encouraging .' (381) |

| Volokh (2011)  Systematic  Review | Faith-based prisons and  programs. | Up to 2010  6 studies  were  published in  2000 or later  and dealt  with prison- based  programs for  adults. | Studies focused  primarily on faith- based interventions  and prison units  with recidivism  outcomes.    Studies on the effect  of religiosity more  generally were  excluded.                                                                                     | 19 studies, generally  classified into four  groups: (1) naïve  comparisons of  participants to non- participants  characterized as  'naked self - selection', (2)  comparisons with  some controls, (3)  matching based on  the propensity  scores, and (4)  comparisons of  voluntary  participants to  people who  volunteered for the  program but were  rejected.  Of note  the author  characterizes this | 'So, after discarding the faith -based prison  studies tainted by self- selection bias, we're left  with two studies that find no effect of faith- based programs, one study that's too small to  be meaningful, and three studies that find  some effect, even if the effect that a few of  these find is quite weak. And of those three,  two aren't about prisoners at all, but about  after-care of released prisoners, and the  remaining one shows no significant effect once  the prisoners have been released. So we have  no study that actually finds a significant effect  of an in-prison faith-based program on  recidivism.' (89 -90) |

No  effect was discovered, though, for less serious forms of  misconduct or for both types of misconduct considered  simultaneously.' (389) The researchers note: 'There are some more general offenses  among the 300 and 400 levels in the BOP that are not specific  to being in prison, such as gambling and indecent exposure,  but these offenses account for a very small part of the  categories and counts of less-serious offenses. It is possible  that program participation has the perverse effect of raising  the likelihood of receiving a 'ticket' for these offenses  because of increased surveillance from program staff and  perhaps even custody staff while i n the program.' (392) 'Comparison groups did not differ on the number of prior  misconduct incidents for the three classifications of  misconduct. This is interesting because prior history of  misconduct was not included in the models predicting  propensity for LCP participation.'  (392) |

Controlled for 27  covariates including  demographics,  criminal history,  recidivism risk,  religious affiliation,  offense type,  misconduct,  participation in prison  programming, and  type of post-release  supervision.  Observable selection  controlled by using  propensity score  matching. | The program significantly reduced the risk of rearrest,  reconviction, and reincarceration, but did not significantly  impact the risk of a revocation. The hazard of recidivism was  lowered by 26% for rearrest, 35% for reconviction, and 40%  for a new offense reincarceration.  The researchers note advantages of this program over other  faith-based programs may include use of the TC model,  targeting of criminogenic needs, i.e., criminal thinking, and  the continuity of care provided by mentors in the program. |

'In general, 37.9% of the sample did return to prison within  the first year after being released, 41.7% returned to prison  within 2 years, and 43.1% returned within 3 years.  Half of the sample comprise men who are part of the MOV  program. Of this amount, about 3% participated in the 6- month aftercare, whereas 1% were program participants in  the year- long aftercare program.' (101) 'Our estimates suggest that the program has been beneficial  in reducing recidivism rates for program participants.  Benchmark estimates imply that the program was associated  with estimated reductions in the probability of recidivating of  6.0 to 8.7 percentage points. This effect is statistically  significant as it implies a 15.8% to 19.2% reduction in the  probability of returning to prison after first release. Our  results are robust when we correct for sample selection based  on unobserved heterogeneity.' (116 -117) |

This  summary focuses on the  outcome study, which  addressed recidivism  rates within 26 months of  release.  696 males and 261  females incarcerated on  9/30/04 at two FCBIs  were analyzed and  compared to individuals  in all other Florida prisons  on that date (n=74,006  males and 4,802  females).  Significant differences  between the criminal  backgrounds of the male  groups were noted, e.g.,  less violent criminal  history, but these  differences were not  found in the female  groups on this variable. | 3 -  Quasi-experimental  design with matched  controls.  Individuals housed at  an FCBI on 9/30/04,  and released between  2004-2005, and  housed in an FCBI for  at least 3 months  were matched to  similar inmates who  were not housed in an  FCBI using a one-to- one categorical exact  matching technique.  Matching factors  included: gender, age,  race, primary offense  type, violent or  nonviolent offense,  number of prior  incarcerations, time  served, and  disciplinary report  rate.

(245) 'There was also no statistically significant difference between  the treatment and comparison groups in the proportion of  inmates who were reincarcerated for a technical violation  (i.e., a parole or probation violation) versus a new crime.'  (245)  'Because the sample sizes are relatively small, however, the  possibility of a small or moderate effect on recidivism cannot  be ruled out. Yet it should be noted that for females, the  effect, while not statistically significant, was in the opposite  direction from what was expected: a greater proportion of  female FCBI inmates were reincarcerated at 18, 24, and 26  months than the inmates from the comparison group.' (245) Of note: 'Because of this variation in program activity at the  facility and individual levels, participation in an FCBI cannot  be treated as a fixed experience that is identical for all  inmates. The lack of standardized programming should be  kept in mind when considering measurements of program  effectiveness and opportunities for replicating the FCBI model  elsewhere.' (240 -241) |

Of this group, 88 men  were interviewed prior to  their release, and of  these men 51 were  interviewed at least once  post-release.

Interviews inquired as to  participation in religious  activities and the  frequency of this  participation.  Quantitative measures  include demographic  data, the TCU Drug  Screen, the Client  Assessment Summary (a  treatment engagement  measure). | 1 -  Primarily a  qualitative study with  limited controls for  quantitative data and  reliance on self-report  measures of religious  involvement.  Subjects were  classified as stably  religious, increasing  religious activity,  decreasing religious  activity or stably non- religious over the  course of the study  interviews.  Controls for relevant  demographic, criminal  history, and substance  use history variables  were applied. | 'The stably non -religious group is the only bivariate  relationship that reaches statistical significance and  membership in this group is related to an increase in the  hazard of recidivism. The bivariate models for the other three  groups, while not statistically significant, suggest membership  in these groups is protective against the hazard of recidivism.   The significant relationship for the stably non-religious group  is attenuated when other covariates are added to the model.

(Northeast US  Women's Prison) | A convenience sample of  36 women - 21 program  participants and 15  comparison subjects,  recruited between 2004- 2005. 'Of the 36  participants who were  recruited, 7 in the  intervention group and  11 in the comparison  group completed the  program during either of  its two administrations.'  (54)  Of note, subjects noted  multiple losses and over  half the sample were  taking one or more  psychiatric medications  prior to incarceration.  Outcome measures  included a semi- structured interview,  Beck Depression  Inventory II (BDI),  Rosenberg Self Esteem  Scale, Spiritual  Perspective Scale, and  Hamilton Anxiety Scale. | 1 -  Weakly designed,  mixed methods study  with a very small  convenience sample.   Pre-/post program  administration of the  four questionnaires,  as well as a mid-point  administration. | 'Participants in the groups described positive outcomes in the  interviews and in the quantitative measurements of anxiety,  depression, and self-esteem. Trends in the data, however,  indicated an additional differential effect related to program  involvement for depression and anxiety scores. The  spirituality scores were high at all times for both groups, with  slight increases over the period of the study.' (46) 'Results indicated decreased anxiety and depression scores  over time, F(1.59, 25.42) = 8.99, p = .00; F(2, 32) = 15.19, p =  .00; respectively, for both the intervention and comparison  groups. There were also trends indicating an interaction  between time and group for both anxiety and depression,  F(1.59, 25.42) = 2.97, p =.08; F(2, 32) = 2.57, p = .09;  respectively, which suggests that those women who  participated in the intervention program had lower  depression scores than did those in the comparison groups  over time.' (56) 'In examining the self -esteem scores over time (see Figure 2),  results indicated there were significant increases in self- esteem scores for both groups, F(2, 32) = 4.42, p = .02.  However, when examining the program impact on self- esteem (e.g., time and group interactions), no statistically  significant difference was found, F(2, 32) = 1.64, p = .21. This  similar pattern of results was also found with spiritual well- being, whereby there was no significant change in spiritual  well-being scores over time, F(1.41, 22.53) = 1.85, p = .19, or  interaction between time and group, F(1.41, 22.53) = 0.01, p =  .99, indicating a similar rate of change for both the  intervention and control groups over the three time points.'
