(2023)","Religious activities
among a group of
men in a TC for
substance use
treatment.
Activities included
faith-based
programs, services,
prisoner-led
religious groups and
interaction with a
full-time chaplain.
(Pennsylvania DOC)","174 men in a TC for
substance use treatment
were the subject of study.
Of this group, 88 men
were interviewed prior to
their release, and of
these men 51 were
interviewed at least once
post-release.
Study included both
longitudinal quantitative
measures from a longer
project paired with in-
depth interviews.
Interviews inquired as to
participation in religious
activities and the
frequency of this
participation.
Quantitative measures
include demographic
data, the TCU Drug
Screen, the Client
Assessment Summary (a
treatment engagement
measure).","1 - Primarily a
qualitative study with
limited controls for
quantitative data and
reliance on self-report
measures of religious
involvement.
Subjects were
classified as stably
religious, increasing
religious activity,
decreasing religious
activity or stably non-
religious over the
course of the study
interviews.
Controls for relevant
demographic, criminal
history, and substance
use history variables
were applied.","“The stably non-religious group is the only bivariate
relationship that reaches statistical significance and
membership in this group is related to an increase in the
hazard of recidivism. The bivariate models for the other three
groups, while not statistically significant, suggest membership
in these groups is protective against the hazard of recidivism.
The significant relationship for the stably non-religious group
is attenuated when other covariates are added to the model.
Across multivariate Cox models, age and highest grade
completed are the only variables that are statistically
significant.” (13-14)
“Ultimately, we see minimal religious engagement post-
prison. Among those who are successful in desisting, religion
only appeared to play a role for the one person who was able
to connect with a robust church community.” (19)"
