enrollment discipline conviction through April 2014 compared
to 24% of the 115 BC participants. For minor misconduct, 47%
of the comparison group had a discipline conviction compared

between BC and comparison group offenders. By the end of

4 times the average (0.35) for BC participants.” (384)"

differences were not found. An effect for reducing recidivism

significantly lower - 8% v. 20.3%."
