improvement postintervention (MI, IPT, CBT,
positive psychology intervention, music therapy,
and ACT) on primary outcome measures such as
symptom severity of depression, anxiety,
substance abuse, and deliberate self-harm.
Positive effects were observed on secondary
outcome measures such as motivation, aggression,
follow-up rates, and recidivism.” (214)"

improvement within the research on suicide and
self-injury in prisons. Research would benefit from
more consistent outcome measures and follow-up
periods, and studies should clarify the target
behavior and make the distinction between
suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal self-injury and
non-suicidal self-injury.” (7)

interventions and uniquely tailored intervention
programs suggest promising results, the general
absence of comparison groups, the
shortage of relevant evaluation studies and the
inconsistency of behavioral outcome
measurements compromise the capacity of this
review.” (1)"
