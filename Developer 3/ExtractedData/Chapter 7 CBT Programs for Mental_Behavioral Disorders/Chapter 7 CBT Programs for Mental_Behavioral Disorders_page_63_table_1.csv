significant reductions in both general and violent
recidivism.
“The RR analysis found an overall risk reduction in
recidivism of 23% for general recidivism and 28%
for violent recidivism after treatment.
The overall risk reduction for treatment
completion as opposed to non-completion was of
a 42% reduction in general recidivism and 56%
in violent recidivism.” (290)
“The analyses also indicate that the less intensive
anger management seemed to be the most
effective treatment modality in reducing offending
behavior especially violent offending.” (291)"
