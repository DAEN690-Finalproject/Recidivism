program (VPP). They
had been released into
the community for at
least 2 years prior to
the extraction of
recidivism data. The
comparison group was
first selected for an
evaluation of a
community based
violent offender
program. Using a case-
to-case matching
process, 60
comparison group
members were
selected from the
national database of
all violent convictions
in 1990 (3,649 cases)
and compared them
with 60 men who had
attended the
VPP. (1617)","comparative analysis of
relevant demographic
variables was undertaken
to establish how
equivalent the groups
were. Significant
differences were found in
the ethnic composition of
the two samples, but
offense history variables
revealed no statistically
significant differences
between the control and
treatment groups. These
findings support the view
that the comparison and
treatment groups were
sufficiently similar for
valid comparisons to be
made”. (1618)","the first-year post release. However, their time to
reconviction was more than twice as long as for
comparison violent recidivists.” (1623)
“Comparisons between nonviolent reconvictions
were not as encouraging. More than half of both
groups were detected and subsequently convicted
for nonviolent reoffending within a few months of
release, and overall, three quarters of the treated
offenders and most of the comparison group
obtained such convictions during follow-up. Treated
offenders appeared, if anything, to reoffend a little
more rapidly than untreated.” (1623)"

interpersonal conflicts and problems related to work
assignments, the program significantly reduced
reported misconducts for men and women in

Solving participants also achieved significantly lower
