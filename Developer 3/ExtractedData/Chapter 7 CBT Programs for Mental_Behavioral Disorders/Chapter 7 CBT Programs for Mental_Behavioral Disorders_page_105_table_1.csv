needed to be longer as their circumstances were
different from a more traditional depression group,
with added difficulties in the type and range of
emotion felt and issues around safety in the group.
They all considered that they benefited from
mindful movement and that this was a
breakthrough for them, in terms of noticing a
reduction in hyperarousal states and generally
helping with extreme aches and pains in the body.”
