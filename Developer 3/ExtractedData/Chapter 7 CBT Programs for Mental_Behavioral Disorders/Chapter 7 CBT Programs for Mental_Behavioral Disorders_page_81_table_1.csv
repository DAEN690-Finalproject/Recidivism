“Findings offer preliminary evidence of the GPS’s
efficacy in achieving change at a cognitive level in
antisocial individuals, when looking at dysfunctional
cognitive processes and/or at underlying core
beliefs. If this cognitive malfunctioning can be seen
as a correlate of emotional and behavioral

selected as targets for change, and programs should
include cognitive change at this level and not only
on cognitive distortions.” (586)"
