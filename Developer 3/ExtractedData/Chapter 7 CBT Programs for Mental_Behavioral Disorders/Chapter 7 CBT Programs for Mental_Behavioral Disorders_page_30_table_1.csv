"To create our study database, we first examined all published meta-analyses and systematic"
reviews of prison-based CBT programs for mental and behavioral disorders published during our
review period (2000-present). Fourteen meta-analyses and systematic reviews were identified
"(see Appendix Table 7A for an overview). As noted in Chapter 1, a strong argument can be made"
evaluations of prison-based CBT programs operating in the 1990’s and earlier are not relevant

"populations. In fact, many of the programs addressed in this chapter were developed in the"
2000’s and later. Our review of these meta-analyses and systematic reviews did reveal several
studies conducted since 2000; we included these studies in our review.
The next step in our study identification process was to determine whether these meta-analyses
and systematic reviews perhaps missed relevant evaluations due to the search procedures
employed; or excluded them from their review due to their study inclusion criteria. To address
"this issue, we conducted a systematic search of the following electronic databases:"
