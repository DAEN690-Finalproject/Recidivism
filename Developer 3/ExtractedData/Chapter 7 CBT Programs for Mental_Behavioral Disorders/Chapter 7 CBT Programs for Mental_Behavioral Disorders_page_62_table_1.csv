“The authors also add a word of caution and call
for more research on cognitive-behavioral
programs to provide more specific information
needed about the programming and its effects.
“The next wave of research should describe the
details of the cognitive-behavioral programs
provided to the clients, including the specifics of
the treatment models and curricula being used,
the training and credentials of the treatment staff,
how frequent the treatment sessions are,
information on supervision procedures to ensure
that the quality of the treatment provided is
maintained, and the planned and actual time in
the program for the clients.” (491)"

“Psychological treatments are generally effective
in treating anger. The results also suggest a
considerable degree of variability in the effect
sizes of specific treatments for anger. The results
show that at least some of the variability may be
explained by the number of treatment sessions
offered to participants, the use of manuals to
guide delivery of the treatment, the use of fidelity
checks, the setting of the research, and whether
the study was published or unpublished.” (473)"
