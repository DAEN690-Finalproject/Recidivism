reduced, as assessed by survival analyses, in both
treated groups compared to the untreated
comparison groups. For those who recidivated, the

by the length of the imposed sentence) in the
treated groups compared to the untreated

lower rates of major institutional infractions (but
not minor infractions) than the comparison groups.”

follow-up was 20% between the TG and UG groups,

nonviolent recidivism, the corresponding reductions
were 11 and 17%.” (108)"
