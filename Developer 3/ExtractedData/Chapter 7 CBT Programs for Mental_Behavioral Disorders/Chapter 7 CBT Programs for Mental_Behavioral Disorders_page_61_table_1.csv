2 studies with both
groups",,,"No overall effects across a variety of psycho-
educational interventions.
For the 5 RCTS: Incidents were lower in the
experimental groups, but the difference between
groups were not statistically significant.
For the 16 quasi-experiments: The results were
mixed, with 8 studies reported no differences in
outcomes for the treatment and comparison
groups, but the remaining studies did find
evidence of effectiveness for some of the outcome
measures.
Setting matters: Of the five studies that were set
in a TC, four produced statistically significant
reductions in violence in the program group
compared to the control group (Dietz, 2003; Lee &
Gilligan, 2005; Magliner, 2013; Welsh et al., 2007)."
