Trial. “Of the 112

in the study, 22 were
from High-security
Facility One (11
traditional, 11 video
conference class), 24
in the second (12
traditional, 12 video

were enrolled in the

facilitated). The

split between

20.53% of the sample
was enrolled in
the video conference

were enrolled in the

average, attended
about 58% of classes

indicating moderate,
but typical,
engagement in the

consenting to participate,
each client was pre-
tested on a reliable and

Some clients, for

through potential
responses and weigh the
costs and benefits of
different alternatives,

and inmate co-facilitation produce statistically
equivalent results when compared to traditionally
run classes. This finding has important implications
and suggests that agencies should continue to study
and experiment with modified formats of TFAC and
CBT more generally, albeit cautiously. As well, the
findings are potentially more relevant in the context
of a pandemic and the ensuing recovery efforts,
which are likely to prioritize social distancing
measures and will require program modifications
going forward. Supporting the efficacy of the
treatment, we find that prosocial changes in
problem solving do occur during the TFAC program.
However, the evidence suggests
those improvements are not conferred by program
completion. Rather, improvements appear to accrue
with an increase in program dosage. Put differently,
the results suggest that some participants benefited
significantly from attending several classes
irrespective of whether they completed the course,
and that some clients completed the course
but apparently benefited less.” (852)"
