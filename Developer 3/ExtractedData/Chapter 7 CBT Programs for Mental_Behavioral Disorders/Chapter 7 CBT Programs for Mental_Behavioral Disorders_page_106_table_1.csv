Treatment was aimed at
modifying maladaptive
coping and social skills, at
enhancing social awareness,
at reducing egoistic and
oppositional behaviors, and
at reducing psychological
complaints. The patients all

“Participants completed
several self-report
measures that were
either used for treatment
outcome measurement
or for additional
diagnostic purposes. The
self-report questionnaires
were administered by
computer. Every 6 to 8
months, the patients
were reexamined using
nearly all self-report
measures as were used at
baseline. Two members
of the staff filled in a
standardized observation
scale, parallel to the
information supplied by
the patients themselves,
with reference to the
functioning of the
patients.” (593)","results are limited. Though the emphasis of the
multidisciplinary treatment was very much on the
cognitive behavioral milieu, it is impossible to
attribute treatment outcome exclusively to this
specific element of treatment.” (600)
“After 2 1/2 years of treatment, patients also were
less likely to react with anxiety, fear, anger, or
aggression in stressful situations. These changes
could also be related to treatment in which patients
are encouraged to be open about their feelings and
are taught alternative behaviors to cope with
unpleasant feelings and stressful situations. Patients
reported significantly fewer avoiding coping
strategies and more social support seeking coping
strategies than at baseline. With respect to
assertiveness, patients reported less anxiety in
interpersonal assertive behaviors, though they were
not acting assertively more frequently.” (602)"
