data were available for
98% of program
completers.","Researcher noted the following:” This study found
that Swedish male prison inmates who completed
the R&R program showed short-term pro-social
changes in sense of coherence, impulsiveness,
venturesomeness, and attitudes towards the law,
courts and police as well as tolerance for crime and
criminal identification. In addition, pro- gram
completers showed a 25% lower risk of reconviction
over a three-year period following prison release,
compared to controls matched to both completers
and dropouts. On the other hand, program
dropouts, younger and more criminally active,
showed a 38% higher risk of reconviction compared
to control.” (98)"

“The treatment group

group also included
offenders who had

were as follows:","2 - Matched comparison

issues. “[Comparison
group subjects] were
matched to the
treatment group (using a
systematic approach
described below) on a
number of variables that
have consistently been
identified as predictors of
reconviction in the
criminological literature
in the UK. The matching
variables were: current
offence, sentence length,
age at discharge, year of
discharge, number of
previous sentencing
occasions and probability
of reconviction score.”
(105)","There was a significant difference in the predicted
direction between the treatment and comparison
group reconviction rates for medium–low and
medium–high-risk individuals. Treatment group
participants had significantly lower rates of
reconviction 2 years post-release. For the low- and
high-risk individuals there was a trend in the
expected direction, although the difference was not
statistically significant.
The authors note a possible confound for the
results: “Despite the study adopting a systematic
matching process, significant differences emerged
between the treatment and comparison groups on
the matching variables. This highlights a
fundamental difficulty when working with non-
randomized experimental designs, i.e., ensuring
comparability between treatment and comparison
group samples.” (111)"
