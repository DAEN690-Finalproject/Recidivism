(2018)",,"Study tests the efficacy of the
Growing Pro-Social (GPS)
Program. It “tested the
program’s ability to increase,
on one hand, cognitive
reappraisal (adaptive
emotion regulation strategy)
and, on the other hand,
decrease expressive
suppression
(maladaptive emotion
regulation strategy) over
time. It was also assessed if
the GPS was capable of
reducing disciplinary
infractions committed by
inmates over time.” (57)

with sufficient samples.
“The GPS’s structure
follows a progressive
strategy of change, which
begins by: (a) increasing
knowledge about the
nature and ambiguities of
human communication,
(b) changing maladaptive
behavioral patterns in
specific interpersonal
contexts, (c) learning
about cognitive
distortions and
counteracting their
influence in the
attribution of meaning to
events, (d) experiencing
and understanding the
function and meaning of
emotions and their
influence on human
behavior, and (e) learning
about early maladaptive
schemas and fighting
against their influence on
thoughts, emotions and
behaviors. This gradual
strategy of change

treatment group as measured by change over time
observed in all outcome measures. “Concerning
emotion regulation, and for cognitive reappraisal,
while the treatment group showed a significant
increase, controls presented a decrease over time. A
different tendency was observed for expressive
suppression, that is, while the treatment group
presented a significant decrease, the control group
showed no change over time. These results support
the assumption that GPS is capable of promoting
emotion regulation, which is one of the program’s
main goals.” (66)
“Concerning behavior regulation, results showed
that the number of disciplinary infractions and the
number of days in punishment significantly
decreased over time in the treatment group. In turn,
the control group showed no change or a worsening
in those same variables over time. These results
pointed out the GPS’s ability to reduce, not only
disciplinary infractions committed by inmates,
but also the number of days inmates were in
punishment. Therefore, GPS achieved the ultimate
goal of any intervention program: changing actual
behavior. Further, these outcomes were directly
observable and quantifiable, thus not relying on
self-report measurement methods.” (67)",,
