,(Iranian Prison),"systematic random
sampling from 2,811
male offenders who
had to spend at least
another 6 months in
prison when the study
started, and whose
minimum level of
education was ninth
grade. The rationale
for using these two
criteria was to have
enough time for
implementing the
intervention program
and to make sure the
participants were able
to understand the
questions and the
program content used
in the study” (745-6).","every three participants
was assigned randomly to
each group. The first
group took part, on
average, in 8 1-hr weekly
individual psychotherapy
sessions that used
cognitive-behavioral
techniques (individual
therapy group). The
second group took part in
16 2-hr weekly group
therapy sessions in
subgroups of 15. The
participants in the second
group simultaneously
attended 8 1-hr individual
psychotherapy sessions
held once a week
(combined therapy
group). The third group
consisted of inmates who
were placed on a waiting
list for individual
counseling (control
group). By the time the
interventions concluded,
48 of the participants in
the individual therapy
group and 46 in the
combined therapy group
had attended a minimum
of 12 sessions of
intervention. In the
control group, 40
participants took part in
the posttest.” (746)","“Recidivism rates were analyzed for inmates who
were released following intervention (n = 96). The
means of release duration for individual, combined,
and control groups were 11.8, 12.3, and 12.3
months, respectively. No recidivism was observed in
the individual and combined treatment groups in
any of the prisons in the country, whereas
approximately 15% of the participants in the control
group returned to prison.” (750)"
