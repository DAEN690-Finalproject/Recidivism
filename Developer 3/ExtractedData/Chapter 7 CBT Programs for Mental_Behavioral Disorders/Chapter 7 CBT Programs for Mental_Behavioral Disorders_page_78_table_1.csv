whether CBT/MT would have protective effects
against any cognitive decline, the evidence was
weak and while “interaction coefficients for
cognitive control and emotion regulation did not

interventions in buffering against some of these
effects.” (48)

evidence to unilaterally support protective effects of
mindfulness” results do “suggest some degree of
buffering against cognitive decline in the CBT/MT
group compared with the significant decline in the
control group.” (49)"
