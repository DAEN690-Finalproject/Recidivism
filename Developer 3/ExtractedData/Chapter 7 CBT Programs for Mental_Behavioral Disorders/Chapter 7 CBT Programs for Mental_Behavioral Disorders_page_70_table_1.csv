been shown to be effective for working with
difficulties identified as dynamic, criminogenic
needs; for example, self-regulation.” (209)
“The potential utility of mindfulness-based
interventions within the correctional system is
increasing as empirical support for mindfulness
therapy continues to grow. Furthermore, as the
rates of mental health diagnoses within the
correctional population continues to grow, the
significance of mindfulness-based programs in
working with individuals with a wide range of
chronic difficulties often seen in correctional
populations cannot be ignored.” (209)
“It is proposed that mindfulness training may exert
its influence by reducing experiential avoidance of
negative affectivity and distress, an experience
common to high-risk situations. Furthermore, as it
has been shown to improve self-regulation skills, a
common criminogenic need targeted in many
CBT/RP treatment programs, it is suggested that
mindfulness meditation may play a role in
reducing recidivism.” (210)"
