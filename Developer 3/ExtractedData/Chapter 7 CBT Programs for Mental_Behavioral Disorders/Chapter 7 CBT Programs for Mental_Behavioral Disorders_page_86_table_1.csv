randomly assigned to
either the MTC group
(n=142) or the MH
group (n=94); final
sample size dropped
due to the exclusion of
any crossovers,
resulting in a sample
size of 185 (92 MTC
and 93 MH subjects).
Outcome measures

variables measured at
12 months post
release. Technical

in recidivism

were conducted to

had used psychotropic medication in their lifetime,
while fewer than half (43%) were taking
psychotropic medications in the 6-month period
prior to incarceration. The Beck Depression
Inventory revealed mild to moderate current
symptomatology.” (489)
Recidivism: “Compared with the MH group, the
overall MTC group showed significantly lower rates
of reincarceration (controlling for age, age of first
incarceration, employment in last year, and number
of residences in the last year), and the MTC +
aftercare group showed significantly better
outcomes across a variety of crime measures.” (489)"

the authors indicate the
low number of
participants contributing
to an implied high Type II
error rate for the
findings.","“The treatment group showed moderate to large
improvement relative to the control group for three
of the five state and trait anger subscales, including,
present feelings of anger, present desire to
verbalize, and trait reactivity to anger-provoking
situations. Effect sizes for the anger scales
attempting to measure how anger is experienced
were all small.” (50)
