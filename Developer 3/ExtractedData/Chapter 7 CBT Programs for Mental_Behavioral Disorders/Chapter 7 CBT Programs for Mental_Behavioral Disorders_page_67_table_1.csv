Note: This review has been critiqued in a recent
review by Harrell et al. (2022).
According to the researchers: “The overall effect
size measured by the correlation across 33 studies
and 30,259 offenders was significant, indicating
that MRT had a small, but important, effect on
recidivism. In practice, the treatment effect
represents an average recidivism rate of
the MRT-treated offenders that was
approximately two-thirds the rate of the
untreated offenders.” (1091)"

but modest overall effect of CBT programs on
post-release recidivism. The absolute difference
between experimental and control groups was .10
(30% experimental vs 40% control). Separate
analyses of adult CBT institutional programs were
not conducted.
Researchers noted: “The mean odds ratio
representing the average effect of intervention
was 1.53 (p<.001), indicating that the odds of
success (no recidivism in the post-intervention
interval of approximately 12 months) for
individuals in the treatment group were more than
one and a half times as great as those for
individuals in the control group. In relation to the
mean recidivism rate for the control groups of
about .40, this odds ratio indicates a recidivism
reduction of 25% to .30.” (7)"
