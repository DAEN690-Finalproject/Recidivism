Project (RSVP)
Program includes 3
components: accountability,
victim restoration, and
community involvement.
Individuals can be mandated
to the program. The
residential program is 12
hours/day, 6 days/week with
workshops, academic classes,
theatrical enactments,
counseling sessions, and
communications with victims
of crimes. Program duration
varies.

of 1 year of court/
criminal records for
101 individuals who
spent 8 weeks or more
in the RSVP compared
to 101 individuals who
were eligible to
participate in the
program but unable to
do so due to lengthy
waiting lists.
Assignment to the
program was not
random.
Note: Individuals who
were transferred
directly from jail to
prison were excluded
from the study, as an
evaluation of
recidivism reduction
was the focus.","2 - Limitations of the
study include the lack
randomization, lack of
matched controls, and
small sample size.
NOTE: Demographic
factors were analyzed via
independent t-tests and
ùúí2 test to confirm
comparability of the two
groups.
To assess lengths of stay
effects, t-tests were used
to compare individuals in
the program for 8 weeks,
12 weeks, and 16 weeks
or more.","Overall, mixed findings reported for the recidivism
analyses, with no effects for overall re-arrest rates,
but significant differences between treatment and
control groups for violent re-arrests.
Individuals who participated in RSVP had lower
rearrest rates for violent crimes (-46.3%, p<0.05)
and spent less time in custody (-42.6T, p<0.05).
The decline in violent re-arrests increased with
greater lengths of stay (-53.1%, p<0.05 for 12 weeks
or more; -82.6%, p<0.05 for 16 weeks or more.
However, weaker statistical strength was noted as
sample sizes dropped as program duration
increased, i.e., 8 week n=101, 12 week n=71, 16
week n=61.
All subjects experienced a lower level of recidivism
after incarceration. Reductions in violent recidivism
for RSVP participants were significantly greater ‚Äì a
reduction of 66.7% v. 41% in the comparison group.
However, overall re-arrest rates were not
significantly different between the two groups."
