“SS was conducted in
group modality for 90
min, typically three
times a week for 6 to 8","4 - RCT with limitations,
such as small sample size
and lack of post-program
data. Researchers noted
the following: “Study
limitations include lack of
assessment of SS
outcomes at end of group
treatment; lack of blind
assessment; omission of
the SS case management
component; and possible
contamination between
the two conditions.”
(325)","No difference between groups. Researchers noted:
“The consistent pattern was that women in both SS
and TAU improved significantly from intake to each
subsequent time point (12 weeks, 3- and 6-month
follow-ups) on each category of measurement (e.g.,
PTSD, substance use, psychopathology).” (331)
“Six months after release from prison, 53% of the
women in both conditions reported a remission in
PTSD.” (325)"
