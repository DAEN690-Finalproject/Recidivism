## COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY PROGRAMS FOR MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS

In this chapter, we review prison-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) programs for mental and behavioral disorders. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) offers thirteen First Step Act (FSA) approved  programs  in  this  category -six  programs  classified  by  the  BOP  as  Evidence-Based Recidivism Reduction (EBRR) Programs, and seven programs classified by the BOP as Productive Activity  (PA)  Programs.  We  begin  by  describing the  BOP's  CBT programs for  individuals  with mental and behavioral disorders, to include the assessment of needs addressed by the programs. We then describe our study identification procedures, provide a review of evaluations conducted both inside and outside  of the BOP, compare BOP programs to evaluated programs in other jurisdictions, and offer an assessment of the effectiveness of each BOP CBT program based on our review. We then conclude this chapter with recommendations for future CBT programming initiatives.

## 7.1 An Overview of Cognitions and Related Needs and CBT Programs for Mental and Behavioral Disorders

The  BOP  offers  a  series  of  programs  for  incarcerated  persons  with  mental  and  behavioral disorders. In other chapters of this report, we address the use of CBT programs in the treatment of  serious  mental  illnesses  (Chapter  5), substance  use  disorders (Chapter  8),  sexual  disorders (Chapter 9), and trauma-related disorders (Chapter 6). In this chapter, we address the use of CBT programs to address other types of mental and behavioral disorders.   All but one of the CBT programs discussed in this chapter are supported by the Psychology Services Branch (PSB) in the Reentry Services Division (RSD). The remaining program is supported by the Women and Special Populations Branch (WSPB), also within the RSD.

As noted in previous chapters, programs for persons with mental and behavioral disorders are staffed primarily by doctoral level clinical and counseling psychologists. For select programs, the staffing complement also includes treatment specialists and social workers with bachelor's or master's  degrees. Training  provided  to  these  staff  is  detailed  in  Chapter  5  of  this  report.    In addition, the one program supported by the WSPB - the Start Now Program - may be facilitated by a variety of staff, as will be addressed in the description of this program.

Programs for incarcerated individuals with mental and behavioral disorders address a series of needs. The CBT programs described in this chapter address primarily cognitions and/or mental

health needs. The BOP's procedures for assessing mental health needs are described in Chapter 5 of this report. In addition to cognitions and mental health needs, a portion of these programs also  directly  anger/hostility  and  antisocial  peers  needs.  Procedures  for  identifying  cognitions, antisocial peers, and anger/hostility needs are described below.

## 7.1.1 Identifying Cognitions and Antisocial Peers Needs

Given  their  CBT  focus,  many  of  the  programs  for  incarcerated  individuals  with  mental  and behavioral disorders address cognitions needs. Program Statement 5400.01 First Step Act Needs Assessment indicates Psychology Services departments are responsible for assessing cognitions needs, as well antisocial peers needs (RSD ,  2021). This policy refers staff to the BOP's internal website, Sallyport, for additional information. According to the BOP, cognitions needs refer to antisocial cognitions 'characterized by a belief and values system supportive of crime' as well as resentment and defiance (BOP, 2022). Antisocial peers needs focus on the risk of involvement in criminal activities when one associates with others engaged in these activities.

The BOP has adopted the Measures of Criminal Attitudes and Associates (MCAA) to evaluate cognitions needs, as well as antisocial peers needs. Like the BOP's approach to the assessment of trauma needs as discussed in Chapter 6, the MCAA is a self-report instrument relying on data provided  by  incarcerated  individuals  via  the  BOP's  internal  computer  system.  The  MCAA examines antisocial associates and attitudes associated with a criminal lifestyle, i.e., violence, entitlement, antisocial intent, and associates (Mills et al., 2004). Attitudes are measured via a 46item scale. MCAA results have been found to be predictive of both general and violent recidivism (Mills et al, 2004). A 2022 BOP report notes 41% of individuals refused to complete the portion of the MCAA related to cognitions and 47% of individuals refused to complete the portion of the MCAA related to antisocial peers. The newly issued Program Statement 5410.01, CN-2, First Step Act of 2018 -Time Credits: Procedures for Implementation of 18 U.S.C. 3632(d)(4) establishes an additional  incentive  for  individuals  to  complete  self-report  needs  assessments  (CPB,  2023). Specifically, individuals will be unable to earn time credits until these assessments are complete. This  new  requirement  will  likely  increase  the  number  of  individuals  who  complete  these assessments. For individuals who do complete the MCAA, 68% present with cognitions needs and 44% present with antisocial peers needs. The MCAA cutoff scores used to identify these needs are not clearly identified in publicly available documents.

## 7.1.2 Identifying Anger/Hostility Needs

A subset of programs for incarcerated individuals with behavioral disorders address the need of anger/hostility. Program  Statement 5401.01 First Step Act Needs  Assessment indicates Psychology Services departments are also responsible for assessing anger/hostility needs (RSD,

2021). According to the BOP, this need involves a 'temperamental and antisocial personality, including  anger  and hostility'  which  'contributes  to  callous,  self -indulgent,  and  rule-violating behavior' in opposition to 'living a prosocial lifestyle and toward a life of criminality' (BOP, 2022). The BOP relies on the Brief Anger-Aggression Questionnaire (BAAQ) to measure this need. The BAAQ is a 6-item screening tool to assess levels of anger and aggression (Maiuro et al., 1987). The  developers  note  'a  cutoff  score  of  9  can  be  interpreted  as  suggesting  anger  dyscontrol problems with a fair degree of confidence' (Maiuro e t al., 1987). Like the ACES and MCAA, the BAAQ also relies on selfreport data provided by individuals via the BOP's internal computer system. A 2022 BOP report notes 9% of individuals refused to complete the BAAQ. For individuals who do complete this assessment, 59% present with anger/hostility needs (BOP, 2022).

## 7.2 Descriptions of CBT Programs for Mental and Behavioral Disorders

The  BOP's CBT  programs  for  incarcerated  individuals  with  mental  and  behavioral  disorders include two residential treatment programs, the Bureau Responsibility and Values Enhancement (BRAVE)  and  Challenge  Programs,  ten  non-residential  Psychology  Services 'Priority  Practice' programs, and one non-residential WSPB program.  The non-residential programs include the Anger  Management,  Basic  Cognitive  Skills,  Criminal Thinking, Emotional  Self-Regulation, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, Circle of Strength, CBT for Suicidal Individuals, Brief CBT for Eating Disorders, CBT for Insomnia, CBT for Prison Gambling, and Start Now Programs. Each program relies on CBT interventions; however, per the BOP's First Step Act Approved Programs Guide, not all these programs address a cognitions need. While most of the programs do address a  cognitions  need,  three  programs address only a mental health need (i.e.,  the MindfulnessBased Cognitive Therapy, CBT for Eating Disorders, and CBT for Insomnia Programs) and some programs  also  address  other  needs,  i.e.,  anger/hostility,  antisocial  peers.  Procedures  for identifying these needs were described above.

As  noted  in  Chapter  5 , the  BOP's  residential  treatment  programs  are  intensive  treatment programs, requiring a minimum of 500 programming hours. The BRAVE and Challenge Programs are such programs. These programs rely on a modified therapeutic community (MTC) model, with dedicated staff facilitators, interactive groups, and community meetings.  These programs are staffed with doctoral level psychologists and bachelor's and master's level treatment specialists. In addition, these staff complete formal training in cognitive-behavioral therapies and the MTC model, including an online training curriculum and 24 hours of in-person training.  Residential psychology  treatment  programs  are  explicitly described in Program  Statement  5330.11 Psychology Treatment Programs (PSB, 2016).  Chapter 1 of this policy details core elements of the  BOP's  residential  psychology  treatment  programs:  a  residential  unit  set  apart  from  the general population with programming rooms and treatment staff offices; clinical components

including  diagnoses  and  individual  treatment  plans  for  each  participant,  the  targeting  of criminogenic needs, therapeutic activities including community meetings, a clinical team that monitors  all  aspects  of  treatment  and  participates  in  clinical  supervision;  and  operational elements  including a written program  philosophy, rules and consequences,  behavioral contingencies, and program rituals.  Program Review Guidelines address these core elements to ensure the program is implemented consistent with the BOP' s model.  As with other residential psychology treatment programs, achievement awards are in place to encourage participation in programming.

Non-residential psychology programs are also offered by Psychology Services departments, but they do not have a dedicated staffing complement. Most of these programs are identified as 'Priority Practices' in the agency and referenced in Program Statement 5310.16 Treatment and Care of Inmates with Mental Illness (PSB,  2016).  Specifically,  this  policy  describes  these  nonresidential  psychology treatment programs as evidence-based practices and group treatment methods addressing core needs of the population.  Per policy, at a minimum Psychology Services departments  offer  at  least  one  Priority  Practice  program  every  quarter.  This  policy  affords institutions significant latitude in selecting specific programs to implement and program-specific Program Review Guidelines do not exist.  Each priority practice does include a fidelity checklist to aid facilitators in ensuring the program is implemented as intended.

As noted above, one non-residential CBT-based program is supported by the WSPB. The program is not explicitly described in policy; however, the program does meet a policy requirement for institutions to offer gender-responsive programming for women (WSPB, 2022).

The  below  table outlines  key  features  of  the  BOP's  thirteen  CBT  programs  for  mental  and behavioral disorders, including the target population, needs addressed, and program dosage. In addition, the table notes the number of institutions offering the program and the number of individuals  participating  in  the  program  at  the  close  of  FY  2023.  Lastly,  the  table  provides  an estimate of the percentage of the target population served by the program to date. Specifically, this estimate compares the total number of program participants and graduates in custody to the total number of individuals in custody with a potential need for such a program. This estimate represents an educated guess, as we did not have access to data allowing for perfect one-to-one comparisons of needs and programs. Following the table, each CBT program is described in detail.

## Residential Treatment Programs

## 7.2.1 BRAVE Program

The BRAVE Program is a residential treatment program, classified by the BOP as an EBRR Program (BOP, 2022).  This cognitivebehavioral program is 'designed to facilitate favorable institutional adjustment  and  reduce  incidents  of  misconduct.    In  addition,  the  program  encourages participants to interact positively with staff members and take advantage of opportunities to engage  in  selfimprovement  throughout  their  incarceration'  (BOP,  2022).    The  program  was developed in 1998 as a pilot project aimed at reducing the risk of institutional disturbances by intervening early with the individuals most likely to engage in these disturbances.  Per the BOP, 'young, newly committed inmates serving long sentences were identified as the group most likely  to  engage  in  both  di sturbances  and  general  institutional  misconduct'  (P SB,  2016). Consequently,  the  target  population  for  the  program  is  newly  designed  medium  security individuals,  32  years  of  age  or  younger,  serving  sentences  of  at  least  5  years.    After  internal research suggested the program significantly reduced misconduct, the program was expanded, and core components were realigned to mirror the BOP's other residential treatment programs. The BRAVE Program focuses on cognitions; however, antisocial peers needs are addressed as well.  Individuals are automatically enrolled in the BRAVE Program based on the target population criteria outlined above.  Individuals may be directly designated to the program, or they may be screened  upon  arrival  to  the  institution  and  placed  in  the  program.    Individuals  are  strongly encouraged to participate in the program, but participation is not mandatory.  Individuals may decline the program. If they decline the program, they are removed from the programming unit.

As  noted  above,  the  BRAVE  Program  relies  on  an  MTC  model  for  service  delivery,  including psychoeducational interventions, cognitive-behaviorally-based interactive groups, skills practice, interactive journaling, and community meetings.  The 6-month, 500 hour program includes halfday  programming,  five  days  per  week.    Program  modules  address  the  following  topic  areas: developing  interpersonal  skills,  behaving  pro-socially  in  a  prison  environment,  challenging antisocial attitudes and criminality, developing problem solving skills, and planning for release. The curriculum is provided via a facilitator guide and a series of interactive journals developed by The  Change  Companies.    Consistent  with  other  residential  treatment  programs,  the  BRAVE Program consists of three phases (PSB, 2016). The orientation phase focuses on building rapport and motivation,  conducting a thorough psychosocial assessment and developing a treatment plan.  This phase requires approximately one month to complete and relies on two interactive journals entitled Orientation and Adjustment to Incarceration.  The core treatment phase focuses on developing prosocial relationships and the skills required to live a drug-free, crime-free, and well-managed life.  Ordinarily, the core treatment phase requires four months to complete and relies on three interactive journals entitled Rational Thinking, Criminal Lifestyle, and Living with Others.  The one-month transition phase focuses on continued practice of prosocial skills as well as realistic expectations and prison living skills. Interactive journals used in this phase include Lifestyle  Balance  and  Success  Strategies.    Progress  reviews  are  completed  every  60  days  and treatment plans are updated accordingly.

The  BRAVE  Program  is  staffed  by  a  doctoral  level  psychologist,  who  serves  as  the  Program Coordinator, as well as four bachelor's or master's level Treatment Specialists. The program has a  1:20  Treatment  Specialist-to-participant  ratio  (PSB,  2016). Program staff  receive  the  BOP's standardized  online  and  in-person  training  on  the  MTC  model  and  cognitive-behavioral interventions. Program Review Guidelines are in place to ensure the program is implemented as intended. Successful completion of the program is based on a participant demonstrating the following behaviors:  taking on the responsibilities of the community, making a commitment to positive change as evidenced by observed positive behaviors, expressing themselves in group demonstrating  the  ability  to  give  and  receive  appropriate  feedback  from  staff  and  other incarcerated individuals, and mastering phase-related concepts (PSB, 2016). Progress reviews are completed every 60 days and treatment plans are updated accordingly. Achievement awards and other tangible awards are provided with successful progress in treatment. In addition to reducing the risk of recidivism, the program's anticipated outcomes are improved institutional adjustment and a reduction in misconduct.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the BRAVE Program is described as available at five institutions -FCI  Beckley, WV; FCI El Reno, OK; FCI Greenville, IL; FCC Victorville, CA; and FCI Williamsburg,  VA  (BOP,  2023).    At  the  close  of  FY  2023  the  program  was  offered  at  all  five

institutions (BOP, 2022). In calendar year 2021, 53 individuals were enrolled in the program and 80  individuals  completed  the  program  (BJS,  2022).    At  the  close  of  FY  2023,  there  were  275 individuals  participating  in  the  program,  up  slightly  from  266  individuals  participating  in  the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 1.33% of the BOP's male, medium security population either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 7.2.2 Challenge Program

The  Challenge  Program  is  also  classified  by  the  BOP  as  an  EBRR  Program  (BOP,  2022).  The cognitive-behavioral, MTC program is designed to address treatment needs in a high security population, to include both substance abuse and mental health needs, to facilitate both favorable institutional adjustment and successful reintegration to the community (PSB, 2016). The program also  addresses  criminality  via  challenges  to  criminal  thinking  errors  (BOP,  2022).  Originally developed in 1997 as a generic treatment program for high security individuals, the program was refocused  in  2006 to  align  with  core  components  of  the  BOP's  other  residential  treatment programs,  e.g.,  basic  cognitive  skills  and  criminal  thinking  modules.  In  addition,  the  revision included  treatment  tracks  focused  on  substance  abuse  and  mental  health  treatment  for individuals with these additional needs. Consequently, the target population for the program is high security individuals with behavioral disorders, as well as a history of drug abuse as evidenced by self-report, Presentence Investigation Report documentation, or incident reports for use of alcohol or drugs and/or a major mental illness as evidenced by a current diagnosis of a psychotic disorder,  mood  disorder,  anxiety  disorder,  or  personality  disorder.  The  Challenge  Program addresses  cognitions,  anger/hostility,  and  antisocial  peers  needs;  however,  as  applicable, substance use and mental health needs are also addressed in the program.

To  be  deemed  eligible  for  the  program,  individuals  are  screened  by  the  Challenge  Program Coordinator, a doctoral level psychologist. Indicators of program eligibility include, but are not limited  to,  a  Unit  Management  referral  for  the  Drug  Education  Program  (see  Chapter  8),  an incident  report  for  the  use  of  alcohol  or  drugs,  a  history  of  substance  abuse  noted  in  the individual's Pre -Sentence Investigation Report, a DSM-5 diagnosis of a major mental disorder, symptoms of a major mental illness, and/or recent placement on suicide watch. Individuals may also self-refer for the program, provided they meet the admission criteria. Eligible individuals are strongly encouraged to participate in the program, but participation is not mandatory. Individuals may participate in the program at any point in their sentence; however, participation early in their sentence is encouraged.

The program is staffed with a psychologist who serves as the Challenge Program Coordinator and a minimum of three master's or bachelor's level Treatment Specialists. The Challenge Program has a 1:20 Treatment Specialist-to-participant ratio (PSB, 2016) . Like the BOP's other residential treatment  programs,  the  Challenge  Program  relies  on  an  MTC  model  for  service  delivery, including  psychoeducational  interventions,  cognitive-behaviorally-based  interactive  groups, skills practice,  interactive  journaling,  and  community  meetings.  The  program  is  explicitly described in policy and there are Program Review Guidelines in place to ensure the program is implemented as intended. The 500 hour unit-based program includes half-day programming, five days per week.

The curriculum is provided via a facilitator guide and a series of interactive journals developed by The Change Companies in collaboration with the BOP. All individuals in the program complete a core curriculum. Core program modules address the following topic areas:  Orientation, Rational Thinking, Criminal Lifestyles, Violence Prevention, Communication Skills, Lifestyle Balance, and Transition (PSB, 2016). The O rientation journal begins to explore the individual's life circumstances  and  starts  them  on  a  path  to  positive  change.  The  Rational  Thinking  journal teaches cognitivebehavioral skills consistent with the BOP's theoretical approach, i.e., rational self-analysis. In the Criminal Lifestyles journal, the origins of criminal behaviors and the impact of a criminal  lifestyle are  addressed.  The  Violence  P revention  journal  explores  individuals' relationship with violence and how to break a cycle of violence. The Communication Skills journal addresses  effective  communication,  anger  management  skills,  and  healthy  relationships.  The Lifestyle  B alance  journal  evaluates  different  aspects  of  an  individual's  life  and  strategies  to balance these areas, e.g., health, work, family. The Transition journal addresses expectations for the future and key transition issues.

In addition to the core curriculum, individuals complete additional treatment tracks, based on their presenting problems (PSB, 2016). Individuals in the substance abuse track complete two additional journals: Reviewing My Drug Use and Recovery Maintenance. The Reviewing My Drug U se journal examines an individual's drug use history and the damaging consequences of drug use. The Recovery Maintenance journal focuses on developing a recovery maintenance plan and developing strategies to exit from a relapse process. Individuals in the mental illness track of the program complete two other First Step Act approved programs, the Illness Management and Recovery and Social Skills Training Programs. Information about these programs can be found in Chapter 5 of this report.

The unit-based portion of the Challenge Program is divided into three phases: (1) the orientation phase, (2) the core treatment phase, and (3) the transition phase (PSB, 2016). The orientation phase  focuses  on  building  rapport  and  motivation,  conducting  a  thorough  psychosocial assessment, developing a treatment plan, and learning to give and receive feedback from staff

and peers. This phase requires approximately one month to complete. The core treatment phase focuses on developing prosocial relationships and the skills required to live a drug-free, crimefree,  and  well-managed  life.  Ordinarily,  the  core  treatment  phase  requires  six  months  to complete. The two-month transition phase focuses on continued practice of prosocial skills as well  as  realistic  expectations  and  living  skills  to  function  in  a  prison  environment.  Successful completion  of  the  program  is  based  on  the  following:    taking  on  the  responsibilities  of  the community,  making  a  commitment  to  positive  change  as  evidenced  by  observed  positive behaviors,  expressing  themselves  in  group,  demonstrating  the  ability  to  give  and  receive appropriate feedback from staff and individuals, and mastering phase-related concepts (PSB, 2016).  Progress  reviews  are  completed  every  60  days  and  treatment  plans  are  updated accordingly.  Achievement  awards  and  other  tangible  awards  are  provided  with  successful progress in treatment. In addition to reducing the risk of recidivism, the program's anticipated outcomes are improved institutional adjustment, a reduction in misconduct, a reduction in the symptoms of a substance use disorder and/or mental illness.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Challenge Program is described as available at 13 institutions (BOP, 2022). At the end of FY 2023 the program was offered at 12 institutions; USP Allenwood no longer appears to be offering the program (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, 516 individuals were enrolled in the program and 190 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023 728 individuals were participating in the program, down from 857 individuals  participating  in  the  program  at  the  close  of  FY  2022  (BOP,  2023;  BOP,  2022).  At present,  6.82%  of  the  BOP's  high  security  either  (1) are  enrolled  in  the  program  or  (2)  have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## Non-Residential Treatment Programs

## 7.2.3 Anger Management Program

The Anger Management Program is classified by the BOP as an EBRR Program 'designed to help individuals  better  manage  their  anger'  (BOP,  2022).  As  initially  implemented,  the  Anger Management  Program relied  on  curriculum  developed  by  the  Substance  Abuse  and  Mental Health  Administration  (SAMHSA)  to  address  the  needs  of  individuals  with  substance  use disorders and anger management issues. The BOP subsequently revised the program to address the  needs  of  a  correctional  population  more  directly  and  a  new  treatment  protocol  was developed  in  collaboration  with  The  Change  Companies  (PSB,  n.d.).  The  stated  goal  of  the program is to teach skills to manage strong emotions such as anger. The target population for this program is individuals with an anger/hostility need, as well as cognitions needs. Individuals

are referred to the program based on an elevated score on the BAAQ, although the specific cutoff score for a referral is not identified in program materials.

The  Anger  Management  Program  is  a  10-session,  cognitive-behavioral  program  consisting  of lectures, group discussions, interactive journaling, and homework assignments. The program is designed  for  delivery  in  a  group  setting;  however,  it  can  be  delivered  individually  as  well. Resources for the Anger Management Program include a gender-responsive facilitator guide and participant manual, which is available in both English and Spanish, from The Change Companies. The  program  relies  on  cognitive-behavioral  and  mindfulness  techniques,  using  an  interactive journaling  and  group  discussion  format,  to  raise  self-awareness  and  enhance  emotional  selfregulation  and  promote  healthy  relationships.  Program  modules  address  the  following  topic areas: what is anger, responding to anger, effects of anger, self-talk, your thoughts and anger, healthy physical habits, the anger iceberg, anger and other people, and my next steps from a cognitive-behavioral orientation (The Change Companies, n.d.).

The Anger Management Program is briefly referenced in Program Statement 5310.17 Psychology Services Manual (PSB, 2016). This policy notes psychologists may offer reentry programming on an outpatient basis and the Anger Management Program is offered as an example of reentry programming. However, no additional information about the program is provided. Criteria for successful completion of the program are not indicated, but likely involve regular attendance and participation. In addition to reducing the risk of recidivism, the program's anticipated outcomes are  a  reduction  in  the  symptoms  of  anger/hostility,  improved  institutional  adjustment,  and  a reduction in misconduct. Program outcomes are not formally measured, but incident reports could likely serve as an intermediate outcome measure as could re-administration of the BAAQ.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Anger Management Program is described as available at all institutions (BOP, 2023). At the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 94 institutions (BOP, 2023).  In calendar year 2021, 2,257 individuals were enrolled in the program and 3,023 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022).  At the close of FY 2023, there were 1,626 individuals participating in the program, up significantly from 1,248 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 17.57% of the BOP population with an anger/hostility need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have  completed  the  program  since  implementation  of  the  FSA  (BOP,  2023).      It  is  not  clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 7.2.4 Basic Cognitive Skills Program

The Basic Cognitive Skills Program is classified by the BOP as an EBRR Program. According to the BOP (2022), this cognitivebehavioral program teaches 'basic concepts…including the 5 Rules for

Rational  Thinking  and  the  use  of  Rational  SelfAnalysis'  to  serve  as  foundational  skills  for additional  programming.  The  program  was  developed  by  the  BOP  and  is  consistent  with cognitive-behavioral modules in other BOP programs. Grounded in the work of Albert Ellis, i.e., Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and Maxie Maultsby, i.e., Rational Behavior Therapy (RBT),  the  core  components  of  this  program  are  found  in  many  of  the  BOP's  cognitive -behaviorally  based  programs,  e.g.,  Residential  Drug  Abuse  Program,  Challenge  Program,  Sex Offender Treatment Programs, BRAVE Program (Ellis &amp; MacLaren, 1998; Maultsby, 1990). The stated goal of the program is to provide individuals with foundational skills as a lead-in to other cognitive-behaviorally  based  programs,  i.e.,  the  Emotional  Self-Regulation  Program  and  the Criminal Thinking Program . The target population for this program is individuals with cognitions needs.  Procedures  for  referring  individuals  to  the  program  are  not  clearly  stated,  but  likely involve cons ideration of an individual's score on the MCAA.

The Basic Cognitive Skills Program is a combination of lectures, group discussions, and homework assignments aimed at teaching the basic concepts of REBT, including the Five Rules for Rational Thinking and use of Rational Self-Analyses (BOP, n.d.).  Typically, the program is completed in 24 hours. Primarily for group treatment, the program may be used for individual treatment in some cases. Resources for the program include a facilitator guide and interactive participant journal, available from The Change Companies (n.d.). The participant journal used in this program was originally developed for use in the Non-Residential Drug Abuse Program (see Chapter 8 of this report).  The journal addresses four core topic areas: (1) learn your ABCs to understand activating events, beliefs, and consequences, (2) five rules for rational thinking to identify and challenge distorted thinking, (3) check your thinking by conducting a Rational Self-Analysis (RSA), and (4) practice, practice, practice by using RSAs in everyday situations. Participants are encouraged to check  their  perceptions,  challenge  their  beliefs,  and  examine  their  choices  as  they  review relevant scenarios. The facilitator guide available on the BOP's internal website notes treatment must include  a  period  of  skills  practice,  with  participants  using  RSAs  in  their  daily  life,  for  a minimum of one month but usually longer (PSB, 2013). Facilitators are encouraged to assign at least three RSAs per week.

The  program  is  facilitated  by  psychologists  or  mid-level  clinical  practitioners  (e.g.,  treatment specialists,  psychology  interns)  under  the  supervision  of  a  psychologist.  Clinical  training  in REBT/RBT  is  required  to  facilitate  the  program.  Facilitators  are  encouraged  to  read Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy: A Therapist's Guide by Albert Ellis and Catherine MacLaren, as well as Rational Behavior Therapy by Maxie Maultsby. A fidelity checklist for the program is available on the BOP's internal website, along with reproducible RSA forms and a reproducible copy of the Five Rules for Rational Thinking. It appears successful completion of the program is based on attendance and participation. The program's anticipated outcome is a reduction in symptoms

associated with unhealthy cognitions, and in turn improved institutional adjustment, a reduction in misconduct, and ultimately reduced recidivism. Program outcomes are not formally measured, but  incident  reports  and  further  program  participation  are  potential  intermediate  outcome measures.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Basic Cognitive Skills Program is described as available at all institutions (BOP, 2023). At the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 62 institutions (BOP, 2023).  In calendar year 2021, 763 individuals were enrolled in the program and 1,248 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022).  At the close of FY 2023, there were 695 individuals participating in the program, up significantly from 439 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 9.76% of the BOP population with a cognitions need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).    It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 7.2.5 Criminal Thinking Program

The Criminal Thinking Program is classified by the BOP as an EBRR Program (BOP, 2022). The cognitivebehavioral  program  is  designed  to  'help  the  participant  see  how  criminal  thinking errors impact decisions in daily life' (BOP, 2022). The program was devel oped by the BOP and is consistent with cognitive-behavioral modules in other BOP programs, such as the Residential Drug Abuse Program (see Chapter 8) and Challenge Program. Program materials are produced by The Change Companies. The program is a companion intervention to the Basic Cognitive Skills Program, which is a prerequisite for this program. The stated goal of the program is to reduce criminality  as  fueled  by  criminal  thinking  errors.  The  target  population  for  this  program  is individuals with cognitions needs, as well as antisocial peers needs. Individuals are likely referred to the program based on their MCCA score; however, a specific cutoff score for program referral is not identified in the program materials.

Per the BOP's internal website, the Criminal Thinking Program is delivered in a 10 -session group format for minimum and low security individuals and a 20-session group format for medium and high security individuals (BOP, n.d.). The program can also be delivered in an individual format. As  with  the  Basic  Cognitive  Skills  Program,  techniques  from  cognitive-behavioral  therapy, including RSAs, are used to examine patterns of criminal thinking occurring across a range of situations.  The  gender-responsive  curriculum  and  accompanying  handouts  are  available  in English and Spanish from The Change Companies. The interactive participant journal 'reviews criminal  thinking  errors,  provides  education  on  the  influence  of  thoughts  and  feelings  on behaviors, and details how to conduct an RSA to improve decisionmaking' (BOP, 2022).  The eight  thinking  errors  addressed  in  the  program  are  aligned  with  errors  identified  by  Glenn

Walters, a former BOP psychologist. The errors include mollification, cutoff, entitlement, power orientation,  sentimentality,  superoptimism,  cognitive  indolence,  and  discontinuity  (Walter, 1990).  These  thinking  errors  are  consistent  with  the  thinking  errors  addressed  in  other  BOP program, including the BRAVE Program and Sex Offender Treatment Programs (see Chapter 9). The concepts and skills are taught via interactive journaling and practice, group session review, and betweensession assignments. The BOP's internal website includes a reproducible copy of a Criminal Thinking Error List and the Five Rules for Rational Thinking (BOP, n.d.). In addition, the internal  website  references  Turning  Point  Criminal  Thinking  handouts  which  were  designed internally as in-cell materials for individuals in restrictive housing. Facilitators are offered the option  of  using  these  handouts  as  homework  activities  to  supplement  the  Criminal  Thinking Program. The internal website also offers a downloadable activity packet to further reinforce the concepts and terminology taught in the program.

As with the Basic Cognitive Skills Program, this program is facilitated by psychologists or mid-level clinical practitioners (e.g., treatment specialists, psychology interns) under the supervision of a psychologist  and  clinical  training  in  REBT/RBT  is  required  to  facilitate  the  program.  A  fidelity checklist for the program is available on the BOP's internal website, along with reproducible RSA forms and a reproducible copy of the Five Rules for Rational Thinking. Facilitators are encouraged to read the previously referenced book by Ellis and MacLaren (1998) as well as the book Rational Emotive  Behavior Therapy  by  Albert  Ellis  and  D.J.  Ellis  and  the  book The  Criminal  Lifestyle: Patterns of Serious Criminal Conduct by Glenn Walters. Successful completion of the program appears  to  be  based  on  attendance  and  participation.  In  addition  to  reducing  symptoms  of criminality, the program's anticipated outcomes are a reduction in misconduct and a reduction in recidivism. Program outcomes are not formally measured, but incident reports would be a reasonable intermediate outcome measure.

In  the  BOP's  FSA  Approved  Programs  Guide,  the  Criminal  Thinking  Program  is  described  as available at all institutions (BOP, 2023). At the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 73 institutions (BOP, 2023).  In calendar year 2021, 572 individuals were enrolled in the program and 877 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022).  At the close of FY 2023, there were 1,034 individuals participating in the program, up significantly from 675 individuals participating in the program  at  the  close  of  FY  2022  (BOP,  2023;  BOP,  2022).  At  present,  10.12%  of  the  BOP population with a cognitions need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).   It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 7.2.6 Emotional Self-Regulation Program

The Emotional Self-Regulation Program is classified by the BOP as an EBRR Program (BOP, 2022). The cognitivebehavioral program is designed to 'help the participant to explore emotions and patterns  of  behavior  and  learn  strategies  for  managing  difficult  em otions'  (BOP,  2022).  The program was implemented as a companion intervention to the Basic Cognitive Skills Program, and the Basic Cognitive Skills Program is a prerequisite for this program. The stated goal of the program  is  to  reduce  the  symptoms  of  emotional  dysregulation  and  to  facilitate  favorable institutional adjustment. The target population for this program is individuals with cognitions and mental health needs, with a focus on mood or anxiety disorders with mild to moderate symptom severity and adjustment disorders with mood or anxiety symptoms. Individuals are likely referred to  the  program based on their MCAA score and/or a DSM-5 diagnosis. The therapy protocol describes the program as ideal for CARE1-MH and CARE2MH individuals. The BOP's interna l website also notes the program may be of value for individuals presenting with a request for antidepressant or anxiolytic medications at intake or during a Psychology Services Open House (BOP, n.d.).

The Emotional Self-Regulation Program is a 24-hour program delivered weekly for at least two months in a group or individual format. In a group format, sessions are usually 90 minutes in length  (PSB,  2018).  These  sessions  involve  an  in-depth  review  of  completed  RSAs.  Following completion of the program, the facilitator may elect to provide monthly maintenance sessions to review RSAs and reinforce REBT skills (BOP, n.d.). The program may also be offered as an openended  therapy group. The gender-responsive curriculum and accompanying  interactive participant journal are produced by The Change Companies and available in English and Spanish. The BOP's internal website also contains a therapy protocol for facilitators and a fidelity checklist for  the  program  (BOP,  n.d.;  PSB ,  2018).  The  program  journal  'explores  helpful  ways  for  the participant  to  respond  to  difficult  emotions  that  lead  to  more  positive  interactions  and outcomes' (BOP, 2022). The concepts and skills are best taught via interactive journaling and practice,  group  session  review,  and  between-session assignments. The curriculum focuses on eight  thinking  errors,  which  mirror  the  thinking  errors  discussed  in  other  BOP  treatment programs,  such  as  the  Nonresidential  Drug  Abuse  Program  (see  Chapter  8).  Originally  the program addressed ten thinking errors, but a 2018 revision reduced the thinking errors to eight. The eight thinking errors are: absolutes, 'I can't', rhetorical questions, awfulizing, statements of facts, demands, loaded words, blaming (Psychology Services Branch, 2018). As with the Basic Cognitive Skills Program, skills practice is stressed. Participants are encouraged to complete at least three RSAs per week, over the course of at least one month, but usually much longer (BOP, n.d.).

As with the Basic Cognitive Skills Program, this program is facilitated by psychologists or mid-level clinical practitioners (e.g., treatment specialists, psychology interns) under the supervision of a psychologist and clinical training in REBT/RBT is required to facilitate the program. The BOP's internal website includes several resources for the program: the program protocol, adjunctive materials, a fidelity checklist, handouts of the thinking errors, Five Rules for Rational Thinking, and RSA forms. Facilitators are also encouraged to read the books by Albert Ellis and Catherine MacLaren  and  Maxie  Maultsby  referenced  in  the  Basic  Cognitive  Skills  Program,  along  with several peer-reviewed articles about the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral interventions. BOP online learning opportuni ties are also referenced, specifically the 'Fundamentals of Treatment' training modules offered to all staff working in Drug Abuse Programs (see Chapter 8). Successful completion of the program appears to be based on attendance and participation. In addition to improving institutional adjustment and reducing symptoms, the program's anticipated outcomes are a reduction in misconduct and a reduction in recidivism. Program outcomes are not formally measured;  however,  mental  health  care  level  could  serve  as  a  viable  intermediate  outcome measure.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Emotional Self -Regulation Program is described as available at all institutions (BOP, 2023). At the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 24 institutions (BOP, 2022).  In calendar year 2021, 241 individuals were enrolled in the program and 279 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022).  At the close of FY 2023, there were 222 individuals participating in the program, up significantly from 135 individuals participating in the program  at  the  close  of  FY  2022  (BOP,  2023;  BOP,  2022).  At  present,  31.03%  of  the  BOP population  with  a  mental  health  need  either  (1)  are  enrolled  in  the  program  or  (2)  have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023). It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 7.2.7 Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Program

The  Mindfulness-Based  Cognitive  Therapy  Program  is  a  PA  Program 'aimed  at  preventing symptom relapse in individuals who have a history of depression and anxiety' (BOP, 2022).  The program is based on the work of psychologists Dr. Zindel Segal of the University of Toronto, Dr. Mark Williams of the University of Oxford, and Dr. John Teasdale, formerly of the University of Oxford, as described in their book Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression (Segal et al., 2018). The stated goal of the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Program is to reduce the symptoms of anxiety and depression. The target population for this program is individuals with a history of depression and anxiety and an associated mental health need. Referral procedures for the program are not clearly noted.

The Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Program is an 8-session, 16-hour group intervention (BOP, n.d.). The program supports daily practice of mindfulness skills and the use of cognitivebehavioral  techniques  to  treat  anxiety  and  depression.  The  protocol  is  based  on  the  above referenced book, as well as a participant workbook by the authors, The Mindful Way Workbook: An 8 Week Program to Free Yourself from Depression and Emotional Distress (Segal et al., 2014) . The workbook is designed to function as a single resource for handouts, home practice sheets, and other content covered in the course. Weekly session topics include beyond automatic pilot, another way of knowing, coming home to the present -gathering the scattered mind, recognizing aversion, allowing things to be as they already are, seeing thoughts as thoughts, kindness in action, and what now. Guided meditation CDs, tools to track progress, and interactive reflection questions are included with the workbook. The BOP's internal website also has a li nk to download these materials if facilitators choose not to purchase the workbook (BOP, n.d.).

A  series  of  meta-analyses  have  supported  the  effectiveness  of  Mindfulness-Based  Cognitive Therapy in treating current depressive symptoms and preventing relapse following the resolution of  a  depressive  episode  (Goldberg  et  al.,  2019;  Kuyken  et  al.,  2016;  Chiesa &amp;  Serretti,  2011). However, these studies note methodological limitations of studies to date, as well as a relatively small number of studies testing the long-term effects of this therapy. In addition, the studies reviewed in these meta-analyses do not involve correctional populations.

In the BOP, the program is to be delivered by psychologists, with expertise in both cognitivebehavioral therapy and mindfulness practice (BOP, n.d.). The BOP's internal website includes a fidelity checklist for the program, which details minimum training requirements for providers. Successful completion of the program appears to be based on attendance and participation. The program's  anticipated  outcome  is  a  reduction  in  the  symptoms  of  depression  and  anxiety. Program outcomes are not formally measured; however, mental health care level could serve as an intermediate outcome measure.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Mindfulness -Based Cognitive Therapy Program is described as available at all institutions (BOP, 2023). At the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 8 institutions (BOP, 2022).  In calendar year 2021, 12 individuals were enrolled in the program and 31 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022).  At the close of FY 2023, there were 23 individuals participating in the program, consistent with the 22 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 4.33% of the BOP population  with  a  mental  health  need  either  (1)  are  enrolled  in  the  program  or  (2)  have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).    It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 7.2.8 Circle of Strength Program

The  Circle  of  Strength  Program  is  a  gender-specific,  pre-treatment  PA  Program 'designed specifically for inmates in Federal Detention Centers or other shortterm settings' (BOP, 2022). The program 'uses a structured format to provide information and resources…while encouraging social support among participants' (BOP, 2022). The pro gram was developed within the BOP. The goal of the program is to offer support and guidance to individuals in short-term placements with cognitions, mental health and/or trauma needs; however, an individual does not have to present with one of these needs to participate in the program. The BOP's internal website notes the program is ideal for detainees who are having difficulty adjusting to their incarceration (BOP, n.d.). The program facilitator guide encourages recruitment of participants via flyers and staff referrals.    Of  note,  the  program  appears  to  be  offered  at  several  non-detention  centers, particularly  at  institutions  for  women  (BOP,  2023).  Interestingly  the  program  shares  some features with the Foundation Program, a pre-treatment program also offered in institutions for women.

The  Circle  of Strength  Program  is  a  13-session,  pre-treatment  program  consisting  of  a combination  of  presentations,  class  discussions,  and  homework  assignments  (PSB,  n.d.). Although  the  program  can  be  offered  in  an  individual  format,  a  group  format  is  strongly encouraged to promote social support among participants. Per the facilitator guide available on the BOP's internal website, group sessions should last 60 minut es and not include more than 12 participants. Participants are seated in a circle, and group membership is open recognizing the high turnover in detention centers. Each session includes the following components: a welcome and  commitment  to  action,  a  15-minute  presentation  of  a  topic,  a  20-25  minute  activity  or discussion related to the topic, and a closing commitment to action. Program modules address the  following  topic  areas  for  men:  adjusting  to  prison,  anger  management,  financial  stress, criminal  thinking,  effective  communication,  surrounding  yourself  with  support,  healthy  sleep habits,  learning  to  relax,  building  a  daily  routine,  health/wellness,  staying  part  of  the  family, substance use, and reentry (BOP, n.d.). Program modules for women address the following topic areas: adjusting to prison, anger, communication assertiveness, depression domestic violence, health/wellness, mothering, sexual abuse, sleep, spirituality, substance abuse, reentry, employment. The protocols are facilitated in an open groups format, and the topic areas are independent of one another and may be offered in any order. Resources for the program include gender-specific facilitator guides and participant handouts, made available to institutions via the BOP's internal website.

The program does not have a dedicated staff facilitator. According to the PSB facilitator guide, facilitators  should  be  mental  health  clinicians.  In  addition  to  the  primary  facilitator,  subject matter experts may join the group to assist with the presentation of special topics. No specialized

training is required to facilitate the course. Successful completion of the program appears to be based on attendance and participation. The program's anticipated outcomes, listed as benefits on the BOP's internal website, include the development of skills to adjust to initial incarceration, the acquisition of information about topics impacting their lives to include evidence-based, high quality resources available via BOP programs, self-help resources, and community supports, and the establishment of mutually supportive relationships during a potentially stressful time (BOP, n.d.). Program outcomes are not formally measured, but future program participation may serve as an intermediate outcome measure for participants who are eventually designated to a BOP institution.

In  the  BOP's  FSA  Approved  Programs  Guide,  the  Circle  of  Strength  Program  is  described  as available at all detention centers; however, at the close of FY 2022 the program was offered at 18 institutions, to include its apparent offering in several non-detention centers (BOP, 2022; BOP, n.d.). In calendar year 2021, 192 individuals were enrolled in the program and 411 individuals completed  the  program  (BJS,  2022).  At  the  close  of  FY  2023,  there  were  212  individuals participating in the program, up from 117 at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, it appears 12.71% of the BOP population who are presently housed in a detention center either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 7.2.9 Brief CBT for Suicidal Individuals Program

The Brief CBT for Suicidal Individuals Program is classified by the BOP as a PA Program designed to provide treatment for individuals at risk of suicide (BOP, 2022). This CBT program is based on the work of two psychologists: Dr. M. David Rudd of the University of Memphis and Dr. Craig Bryan of the University of Utah. The stated goal of the program is to reduce the risk of suicide and  self-injurious  behaviors.  The  target  population  for  this  program  is  individuals  at  risk  for suicide. Per the BOP's internal website, the program is useful following a suicide attempt or a Suicide Risk Assessment suggesting moderate-high risk for suicide (BOP, n.d.). If an individual is placed on suicide watch, the protocol  may be initiated before an individual is removed from suicide  watch  or  shortly  thereafter. Program Statement 5324.08 Suicide  Prevention  Program details procedures to identify at-risk individuals and conduct suicide risk assessments, ensuring appropriate individuals can be targeted for this program (Psychology Services Branch, 2007).

The Brief CBT for Suicidal Individuals Program is a 20-hour treatment program, applicable for individual or group administration. The program begins with 'a focus on crisis intervention and the development of a safety plan, as well as the development of cognitive strategies to help modify  negative  thoughts  that  can  lead  to  selfdirected  violent  behaviors'  (BOP,  2022).  The protocol is described in the book Brief Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Suicide Prevention by M.

David Rudd and Craig Bryan. Per the BOP's internal website, 'the treatment requires identifying contributors to the suicidal mode and then focusing on changing those specific factors' (BOP, n.d.). The treatment protocol is divided into phases. In phase one, treatment providers are to conduct a risk assessment, develop a cognitive-behavioral conceptualization, engage in safety planning and crisis response planning, ensure means restriction, and facilitate the development of  basic  distress  tolerance  and  emotional  regulation  skills.  In  phase  two,  facilitators  focus  on cognitive  restructuring  to  undermine  a  suicidal  belief  system  and  continued  skills  training  to refine  emotion  regulation,  distress  tolerance,  and  problem  solving.  Of  note,  the  cognitive restructuring techniques used rely on the thinking errors and RSAs used in other BOP programs referenced in this chapter, i.e., BRAVE, Basic Cognitive Skills, and Criminal Thinking Programs. In phase three, the final phase of the program, facilitators educate the individual about relapse prevention and the associated treatment tasks. The complete treatment protocol is provided on the BOP's internal website. In addition, the website contains protocol supports, i.e., objectives by  treatment  phase,  fidelity  checklists,  and  an  emotions  handout.  Spanish  translations  of participant handouts and clinician scripts are also available on the website.

A systematic review and meta-analysis by Tarrier et al. (2007) examining the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral interventions to reduce suicide behavior noted a highly significant effect overall for CBT in reducing suicide behavior. They went on to conclude: 'Subgroup analysis indicates a significant treatment effect for adult samples (but not adolescent), for individual treatments (but not group), and for CBT when compared to minimal treatment or treatment as usual (but not when compared to another active treatment). There was  evidence  for  treatment  effects,  albeit  reduced,  over  the  medium  term.  Although  these results appear optimistic in advocating the use of CBT in ameliorating suicidal thoughts, plans, and behaviors, evidence of a publication bias tempers such optimism.' Research specific to a correctional population was not included in the systematic review and meta-analysis.

According to the BOP (2022), the program is facilitated by psychologists. The BOP provides formal training in the intervention via a 24hour course facilitated by Dr. David Rudd, the program's co -developer.  Per  the  BOP's  internal  website,  'progression  thro ugh  the  protocol  is  competency based and inmates must master skills associated with each phase of treatment prior to moving to the next phase' (BOP, n.d.). The anticipated outcome of the program is a reduction in the risk of suicide, typically accompanied by a reduction in the symptoms of a mental illness and the acquisition of coping skills. Although outcome data is not formally collected, a reduction in the need for suicide risk assessments would be a viable and accessible outcome measure.

In  the  BOP's  FSA  Approved Programs Guide, the Brief CBT for Suicidal Individuals Program is described as available at all institutions (BOP, 2023). At the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 8 institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, no individuals were enrolled in the

program and 1 individual completed the program (BJS, 2022).  At the close of FY 2023, there were 11 individuals participating in the program, up from 4 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022).  At present, .70% of the BOP population with a mental health need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program, or why this program appears to be significantly underutilized given the need for suicide prevention efforts in a correctional setting.

## 7.2.10  CBT for Eating Disorders Program

The  CBT  for  Eating  Disorders  Program  is  a  PA  Program designed  to  provide  'assessment, stabilization, and education for individuals who have been diagnosed with an eating disorder' (BOP, 2022). The program is based on the work of Dr. Christopher Fairburn of the University of Oxford as described in his two books Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Eating Disorders and Overcoming  Binge  Eating (Fairburn,  2008;  Fairburn,  2013).  The  protocol  is  described  as  an empirically supported treatment employing a 'transdiagnostic theory of eating disorders' (BOP, n.d.). The stated goal of the program is to effectively treat the symptoms of an DSM-5 eating disorder. The target population for this program is individuals with an eating disorder and an associated  mental  health  need.  Individuals  are  referred  to  the  program  based  on  a  DSM-5 diagnosis of an eating disorder.

The  CBT  for  Eating  Disorders  Program  consists  of  20-40  1-hour  sessions.  Although  the  FSA Approved  Programs  Guide  indicates  the  program  can  be  provided  in  an  individual  or  group format, the BOP's internal website describes the program solely as an individual intervention. The program focuses on 'behavioral monitoring, body image concerns, and t he development of new skills' (BOP, 2022).  The program is divided into four phases: 'assessment, stabilization, and education;  behavioral  monitoring;  addressing  concerns  that  maintained  the  program such  as body image; and maintenance of new skills' (BOP, n.d.). Dr. Fairburn's book, Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Eating Disorders , includes chapters for key program components, including chapters addressing the following themes: starting well; achieving early change; taking stock and designing the rest of treatment; shape concern, shape checking, feeling fat and mindsets; dietary restraint, dietary rules and controlling eating; events, moods and eating; underweight and undereating; and ending well (Fairburn, 2008). Dr. Fairburn's other book, Overcoming Binge Eating: The Proven Program to Learn Why You Binge and How You Can Stop, includes chapters for key program components related to binge-eating interventions: getting ready; starting well; regular eating; alternatives to binge eating; problem solving; taking stock; dieting; body image; and ending well (Fairburn, 2013). The BOP's internal website suggests the use of pre/post-test measures within the program, specifically, the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE), a structured clinical interview, or  the  Eating  Disorder  Examination  Questionnaire  (EDE-Q),  a  self-report  questionnaire  based

upon the EDE (Fairburn et al., 2014). The BOP's internal website also includes links to program handouts and assessments.

A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis by Linardon et al. suggested CBT is an effective treatment intervention for the treatment of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder; however, the researchers also noted many of the 79 RCTs reviewed were of poor quality noting the need for additional quality research in this area before drawing firm conclusions.  Linardon et al.'s work did not reference the use of correctional populations in the studies reviewed.

According to the FSA Approved Programs Guide, program facilitators should be mental health clinicians (BOP, 2023). Links to facilitator training resources are provided on the BOP's internal website, i.e., the two books published by Dr. Fairburn. Successful completion of the program appears to be based on regular participation in individual or group therapy sessions, as well as favorable results on posttest measures. The program's anticipated outcome is a reduction in the symptoms of an eating disorder/binge eating. Intermediate program outcomes are not formally measured, but periodic re-administration of the above assessment instruments could serve as intermediate outcome measures, as could weight, vital signs, lab values, and mental health care levels.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the CBT for Eating Disorders Program is described as available at all institutions (BOP, 2023). At the close of FY 2023 the program was not offered at any institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, no individuals were enrolled in the program and no individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022).  At the close of FY 2023, there were no individuals  participating  in  the  program,  nor  were  there  any  individuals  participating  in  the program in FY 2022. A single individual in BOP custody is noted to have completed the program. It is not clear why this program is not being offered.

## 7.2.11  CBT for Insomnia Program

The CBT for Insomnia Program is a PA Program 'designed to help identify maladaptive thoughts and behaviors that can lead to persistent insomnia' (BOP, 2022). The program is based on the work of psychologist Dr. Michael L. Perlis of the University of Pennsylvania, nurse practitioner Dr. Carla Jungquist of the University of Buffalo, psychologist Dr. Michael T. Smith of Johns Hopkins University, and psychologist Donn Posner of Stanford University School of Medicine as described in their book Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia: A Session by Session Guide (Perlis et al., 2005). The stated goal of the CBT for Insomnia Program is to support healthy sleep patterns. The target population for this program is individuals with a sleep disturbance, i.e., insomnia and an  associated  mental  health  need.  Referral  procedures  are  not  explicitly  described,  but  selfreported sleep disturbances are likely how individuals are identified for program participation.

The  CBT  for  Insomnia  Program  is  a  4-8  session  treatment  protocol  for  individuals  with  sleep disturbances  (BOP,  n.d.).  The  program  includes  the  following  components:  'assessment, motivational strategies, patient education, behavioral treatments for insomnia, and cognitive approaches to decrease anxiety about sleep' (BOP, n.d.). Sessions are offered weekly on either an individual or small group basis. Specific session topics vary, based on individual needs; key topics addressed include good sleep hygiene, cognitive restructuring of catastrophic thoughts, maintenance of sleep diaries, and the use of sleep medications. Per the BOP's internal website (n.d.), the protocol and a video of sample sessions is available for purchase from the authors or may be obtained from the PSB.

A  2019  meta-analysis  by  van  der  Zweerde  et  al.  suggested  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  for insomnia is an effective intervention in addressing the severity of insomnia, sleep onset latency, and sleep efficiency.  While these effects decline over time, clinically significant effects were noted up to 12 months after therapy.  Of note, this meta-analysis did not appear to include any correctional populations.

According to the FSA Approved Programs Guide, facilitators should be mental health clinicians (BOP, 2023). Links to facilitator training resources and the referenced book, Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of  Insomnia:  A  Session  by  Session  Guide, are  also  provided  on  the  BOP's  internal website.  Successful  completion  of  the  program  appears  to  be  based  on  attendance  and participation. The program's anticipated outcome is a reduction in the symptoms of insomnia and  other  sleep  disturbances.  Program  outcomes  are  not  formally  measured;  however,  selfreports  of  sleep  quality  and  mental  health  care  levels  might  serve  as  intermediate  outcome measures.

In  the  BOP's  FSA  Approved  Programs  Guide,  the  CBT  for  Insomnia  Program  is  described  as available at all institutions (BOP, 2023). At the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 8 institutions (BOP, 2023).  In calendar year 2021, 20 individuals were enrolled in the program and 20  individuals  completed  the  program  (BJS,  2022).  At  the  close  of  FY  2023,  there  were  16 individuals participating in the program, up from 11 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 3.54% of the BOP population with a mental health need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).   It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 7.2.12  CBT for Prison Gambling Program

The CBT for Prison Gambling Program is a PA Program 'designed to help individuals assess their prison gambling behavior and to develop the commitment to quit' (BOP, 2022). Research efforts

to identify the prevalence of problem gambling in prison have yielded varying results. In their systematic review, Banks et al. (2020) found prevalence rates ranging from 5.9% to 73% in a correctional population. Whereas Williams et al. (2005) found an average prevalence rate of 33% across 27 studies in Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the United States.

Originally,  the  BOP  conducted  field  trials  of  gambling  treatment  models  from  the  UCLA  and University  of  Calgary;  however,  these  models  suggested  moderate  gambling  might  be  an appropriate goal, which is not accurate in a prison setting, and the examples also tended to focus on gambling activities not common in a prison setting (PSB, n.d.). To address these limitations, the PSB adapted the workbooks to apply more directly to gambling activities by incarcerated individuals.  Specifically,  abstinence  was  identified  as  the  only  appropriate  goal,  and  casino gambling examples were replaced with sports betting and dice games often found in prison. The stated goal of the CBT for Prison Gambling Program is to eliminate problem gambling. The target population for this program is individuals with a gambling problem and cognitions and antisocial peers needs. Individuals who have received incident reports for gambling while in prison or who self-report gambling problems are appropriate candidates for this program.

The CBT for Prison Gambling Program is a 20-hour, self-guided program. Resources for the CBT for Prison  Gambling  Program  include  four  cognitive-behavioral  handouts  with  journaling activities totaling 36 pages, made available to institutions via the BOP's i nternal website (BOP, n.d.). The first two handouts guide participants through a series of activities to evaluate their preferred forms of prison gambling and to review the benefits and negative consequences of gambling in their lives (PSB, n.d.). The last two handouts teach participants about thinking errors underlying  prison  gambling,  specifically  super-optimism  and  power  orientation.  The  final handout also includes an opportunity to request additional services.

A recent meta-analysis by Pfund et al. (2023) drew the following conclusions about the efficacy of cognitivebehavioral therapies in the treatment of gambling problems: 'Cognitive -behavioral techniques are a promising treatment for reducing gambling disorder and gambling behavior; however,  the  effect  of  cognitive-behavioral  techniques  on  gambling  disorder  severity  and gambling frequency and intensity at post-treatment is overestimated, and cognitive-behavioral techniques  may  not  be  reliably  efficacious  for  all  individuals  seeking  treatment  for  problem gambling and gambling disorder' (p. 1). In addition, this meta-analysis did not include studies involving correctional populations.

As  noted  above,  the  handouts  are  primarily  self-guided,  but  motivational  enhancement  and clinician feedback may be incorporated into the program (BOP, n.d.). The PSB 's Prison Gambling: Self-Guided CBT Protocol notes the program can be supplemented by also offering the Criminal Thinking Program and/or by offering the Freedom from Problem Gambling: Self-Help Workbook

developed by UCLA and based  on the Becoming a Winner workbook from the University  of Calgary (PSB, n.d.; Wong &amp; Rosenthal, 2014; Hodgins &amp; Makarchuk, 2000). Successful completion of the program is based on completing all four handouts; however, the PSB protocol notes it is not expected that these handouts alone will remedy the problem. To increase the likelihood of behavior change, psychologists are encouraged to supplement the self-guided materials with a small  number  of  motivational  psychotherapy  sessions  and/or  to  enroll  the  individual  in  the Criminal Thinking Program. Pre-test and post-test knowledge measures are included in the first and fourth handouts and a favorable score on the post-test knowledge measure is linked to successful  program  completion.  Longer-term  program  outcomes  are  not  formally  measured; however,  tracking  incident  reports  for  gambling  could  serve  as  an  intermediate  outcome measure for the program.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the CBT for Prison Gambling Program is described as available at all institutions (BOP, 2023). At the close of FY 2023 the program was offered at 28 institutions (BOP, 2023).  In calendar year 2021, 198 individuals were enrolled in the program and 576  individuals  completed  the  program  (BJS,  2022).  At  the  close  of  FY  2023,  there  were  99 individuals participating in the program, down from 125 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 4.30% of the BOP population with a cognitions need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023). It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 7.2.13  Start Now Program

The final program in this chapter, the  Start Now Program, is a PA Program supported by the WSPB. The program is designed to treat individuals with behavioral disorders and associated behavioral problems. Originally developed at UCONN as an intervention for adolescent females in  criminal  justice  settings,  the  program  has  been  expanded  and  refined  to  serve  a  broader correctional population. Program development was funded by the National Institute of Justice to explore  the  feasibility  of  offering  dialectical  behavior  therapy  interventions  in  a  corrections environment (Sampl et al. 2015).  The program uses a strengthsbased approach applying 'an accepting and collaborative clinical style' and placing 'the primary responsibility for change on the individual' (BOP, 2022).  The stated goal of the program is to reduce behavioral p roblems. The target population for this program is women with behavioral disorders and an anger/hostility and/or cognitions need, which is why the program is supported by the WSPB. However, of note, a male version of the program is now made available to staff via Sallyport. The procedures for referring an individual to the Start Now Program are not clearly described in available resources.

The  Start  Now  Program  is  a  32-hour  program  consisting  of  a  combination  of  presentations, interactive groups and journaling, and homework assignments. Sessions may be delivered twice weekly over 16 weeks or once per week over 32 weeks; however, twice weekly sessions are the recommended  protocol.  As  noted  above,  the  program  was  originally  developed  at  the Department  of  Correctional  Managed  Health  Care,  University  of  Connecticut.  According  to Kersten et al. (2016), 'the focus of the intervention is on (1) incr easing self-control over impulses, (2) enhancing emotion recognition and regulation, (3) making judgements and decisions on the basis of consequences and (4) improving stress management and coping skills.'  The program combines  elements  of  cognitive-behavioral  therapy,  motivational  interviewing,  dialectical behavior  therapy,  and  trauma-informed  care.  Four  gender-responsive  Start  Now  Program modules are available in the public domain on the Carilion Clinic website, a not-for-profit health care organization based in Roanoke, VA. The first module, entitled My Foundation: Starting with Me, teaches the skill of focusing and the ABC's of c ognitive-behavioral therapy. Module two, entitled, My Emotions: Dealing with Upset Feelings, addresses impulsive behaviors and coping skills  for  difficult  emotions.  Module  three,  My  Relationships:  Building  Positive  Relationships, focuses  on  the  skills  required  for  successful  relationships.  The  final  module,  My  Future: Continuing My Path to Success, addresses goal setting and problem solving specific to key reentry skills. Participant workbooks are psychoeducational and interactive. A series of program support resources are available on the Carilion Clinic website, to include a facilitator workbook/manual, facilitator  training  presentation  (video),  quality  assurance  forms  for  observed  sessions,  a knowledge test for facilitators.

According to the BOP (2022), the program may be facilitated by a variety of staff, including special programs coordinators, Education, Health Services and Unit Team staff, psychologists, treatment specialists,  contractors,  and  volunteers.  As  noted  above,  facilitator  training  resources  are available  on  the Carilion  Clinic  website,  but  staff  are  not  required  to  complete  these  training certification  procedures.  The  certification  training  requires  facilitators  to  read  the  facilitator manual and participate in two days of live training (Sampl et al., 2015). Information available to staff on Sallyport indicates experience in a correctional setting and counseling experience are desirable for program facilitators. Resources in the facilitator guide include quality assurance measures as well as recommended outcome measures to track program effectiveness.  These measures include behavioral indicators, such as disciplinary infractions, as well as a suggested self-report instrument, the Buss-Perry Aggression Scale. Successful completion of the program appears to be based on attendance and participation alone.  The program's anticipated outcome is a reduction in the symptoms and negative consequences of a behavioral disorder.  As noted above, suggested outcome measures are included in the facilitator's manual, but use of these measures is not mandated.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the S tart Now Program is described as available at all institutions; however, at the close of FY 2022 the program was offered at 29 institutions (BOP, 2023).  In calendar year 2021, 162 individuals were enrolled in the program and 249 individuals completed  the  program  (BJS,  2022).  At  the  close  of  FY  2023,  there  were  842  individuals participating  in  the  program,  up  very  significantly  from  118  individuals  participating  in  the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2023; BOP, 2022). At present, 4.51% of the BOP population with a cognitions need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023). It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 7.3 Study Identification Procedures

To  create  our  study  database,  we  first  examined  all  published  meta-analyses  and  systematic reviews of prison-based CBT programs for mental and behavioral disorders published during our review period (2000-present). Fourteen meta-analyses and systematic reviews were identified (see Appendix Table 7A for an overview). As noted in Chapter 1, a strong argument can be made evaluations of prisonbased CBT programs operating in the 1990's and earlier are not relevant today,  because  of  changes  over  time  in  program  design  components  and  incarcerated populations. In fact,  many  of the programs addressed in this chapter were developed in the 2000's and later. Our review of these meta-analyses and systematic reviews did reveal several studies conducted since 2000; we included these studies in our review.

The next step in our study identification process was to determine whether these meta-analyses and  systematic  reviews  perhaps  missed  relevant  evaluations  due  to  the  search  procedures employed; or excluded them from their review due to their study inclusion criteria. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic search of the following electronic databases:

- · APA PsycInfo
- · Complementary Index
- · Academic Search Premier
- · MEDLINE
- · Criminal Justice Abstracts
- · CINAHL Plus with Full Text
- · Gale Academic OneFile
- · National Criminal Justice Reference Service Abstracts
- · Gale OneFile: Health and Medicine
- · Gale General OneFile
- · Supplemental Index

- · Education Research Complete
- · Gale Academic OneFile Select
- · Springer Nature Journals
- · Books at JSTOR
- · Research Starters

- · Gale in Context: Science
- · Gale OneFile: High School Edition
- · IEEE Xplore Digital Library
- · Regional Business News
- · ERIC
- · Gale OneFile: News
- · Historical Abstracts
- · Political Science Complete

We used the following specific terms for our systematic search of electronic databases:

cognitive behavioral therapy AND prison or jail or incarceration or imprisonment or correction facilities NOT youths or young people or adolescents or teenagers

This search initially yielded 880 hits, with a list of 594 studies once duplicates were removed from the database. Visual inspection of the titles and abstracts by the research team further reduced the number of potential studies to 110 titles requiring in-depth review. Specifically, we focused on studies that included one of the outcomes measures described in Chapter 1 (i.e., recidivism reduction,  misconduct  reduction,  improved  institutional  adjustment,  skills  acquisition)  and identified a control group for comparison. 1

The majority of the 110 studies we examined in-depth did not meet our review criteria and were excluded.  A  total  of  40  studies  were  identified  for  inclusion  in  our  review,  which  include  25 evaluations ranked level 3 or above in design quality, and 15 evaluations using lower quality research designs (1 or 2). See Appendix Table 7B for an overview of these studies.

In addition, we decided to conduct a separate search, in the same series of databases, for anger management program evaluations. The following search terms were used in this second search:

anger management AND prison or jail or incarceration or imprisonment or correction facilities NOT youths or young people or adolescents or teenagers AND recidivism or reoffending or repeat offender.

This search initially yielded 335 hits, with a list of 17 studies once duplicates were removed from the database. Visual inspection of the titles and abstracts by the research team further reduced the number of potential studies to 7 titles meeting our initial review criteria and requiring indepth  review.    In  addition,  one  meta-analysis  of  96  anger  management  programs  utilizing  9 distinct  program  models  (Saini,  2009)  was  also  identified  at  this  stage  and  reviewed  (see Appendix Table 7A); only 4 of the 12 corrections studies included in this review were conducted post-2000. This secondary search added 3 previously unidentified studies to our database.

Based on our review of the studies included in the fifteen meta-analyses and systematic reviews highlighted  in  Appendix  Table  7A,  along  with  the  results  of  our  two  searches  of  electronic databases,  we  identified  43  evaluations  of  prison-based  CBT  programs  for  mental  and/or behavioral disorders from the period 2000 to 2022 that meet our review criteria (see Appendix Table 7B for an overview of each study).

## 7.4 Evaluations of CBT Programs for Mental and Behavioral Disorders Inside the BOP

Our  search  only  identified  one  evaluation  of  a  BOP  program  that  was  completed  during  our review period: Chris Innes' evaluation of BOP's BRAVE Program (Innes, 2000). A level 3 quasiexperimental design was employed to compare 289 BRAVE Program participants to a matched comparison group of incarcerated individuals admitted to the facility at the same time who did

not participate in the program . Positive results were reported, including significantly lower rates 2 of misconduct for both participants (24.2% lower rate of misconduct) and completers (53.1% lower rate of misconduct). Lower placement rates and lengths of stay in secure housing units (SHUs) were also reported. We hesitate to rate the BRAVE Program as promising based on a single level 3 study conducted over two decades ago.

BOP has begun to address this evaluation need. They began an internal evaluation of the BRAVE Program at the end of FY 2021; it is described as a joint internal evaluation being conducted Office of Research Evaluation (ORE)in conjunction with the Psychological Services Bureau (PSB). The evaluation is focused on both in-prison outcomes  (such as reduction in mental health crises, disciplinary actions, and other measures of institutional adjustment), and post-release outcomes (recidivism). We did not have the opportunity to view any preliminary findings, but data analysis is currently ongoing, and a final report will be available in FY 2026 according to BOP.

In the interim, the positive findings reported for BOP's BRAVE Program now need to be viewed in conjunction with the available state-level evaluation research on programs that appear to be similar to the BRAVE Program. We examine these studies in the following section.

In  addition  to  these  internal  evaluations,  BOP  has  currently  contracted  with  Texas  Christian University to evaluate  several of their CBT-based programs, including its  Anger Management Program. The Anger Management Program evaluation was started in FY 2021, and it is scheduled to  be  completed  in  FY  2024.  The  evaluation  will  purportedly  include  an  assessment  of  both intermediate, in-prison outcomes (e.g., reductions in ager, disciplinary actions) and post-release recidivism. The BOP has also contracted with Rutgers University to evaluate the effectiveness of its Criminal Thinking Program, with a target completion date of FY 2028. The BOP also plans to initiative evaluations of the Basic Cognitive Skills Program in FY 2023 and the Emotional SelfRegulation Program in FY 2026.

## 7.5 Evaluations of CBT Programs for Mental and Behavioral Disorders Outside BOP

We begin our review CBT program evaluations conducted outside of BOP by summarizing the results  of  the  meta-analyses  and  systematic  reviews  conducted  during  our  review  period. Appendix Table 7A presents the key findings from these reviews. Overall findings from these reviews  are  positive,  both  in  terms  of  in-prison  and  post-release  outcomes.  However,  a  few critical  caveats  are  in  order  when  considering  whether  these  meta-analyses  and  systematic reviews can be used to inform decisions about the effectiveness of prison-based CBT programs. First,  many  of  the  studies  included  in  these  reviews  were  conducted  prior  to  2000.  Second, several of these reviews included both prison-based studies and community-based studies. Third, many of these reviews included both adult and juvenile populations. And fourth, the outcome measures included in most of the evaluations highlighted in these reviews focused on in-prison behavior (i.e., rates of overall and violent misconduct, and changes in mental health). Data on post-release recidivism and/or other post-release adjustment measures were examined in only 6 of 17 meta-analyses and systematic reviews included in Appendix Table 7A.

These caveats notwithstanding, it can be reported that the bulk of the evaluation research does support the use of a variety of CBT techniques for anger management, to improve basic cognitive skills, to address criminal thinking, and for emotional self-regulation. Several CBT programs were found to improve in-prison mental health, and/or reduce institutional misconduct and prison violence (see, e.g., Autry et al., 2017). Evidence supporting the significant, albeit modest, postrelease recidivism reduction effects  of various CBT treatment programs is found in the following 3 seven meta-analyses and systematic reviews: Thekkumkara et al., 2022; Beaudry et al., 2021; Landenberger and Lipsey, 2005; Wilson et al., 2005; Pearson et al., 2002; Ferguson and Wormith, 2012; and Henwood et al., 2015). However, it would be a mistake to rely solely on these metaanalyses and systematic reviews to decide whether a specific BOP program can be described as

evidence  based.  This  determination  requires  an examination  of  only  adult,  prison-based  CBT program evaluations conducted during our review period.

Appendix  Table  7B  presents  the  results  of  43  separate  adult,  prison-based  CBT  program evaluations conducted since 2000. Sixteen [16] of these evaluations were randomized control trials (RCTs), but several had design limitations related to either small sample size or length of follow-up. Four of these 16 RCTs attempted to measure post-release criminal behavior (Sacks et al.,  2012;  Sacks  et  al.,  2008;  Sacks,  2004;  and  Khodayarifard,  2010),  while  3  studies  included measures of post-release mental health (Sacks et al, 2012; Sacks et al., 2008; and Zlotnick et al., 2009). This leads us to conclude that very little high-quality evaluation research on either postrelease mental health effects or the recidivism reduction effects of participation in prison-based CBT  programs  has  been  conducted  since  2000.  A  similar  assessment  applies  to  the  quasiexperimental  CBT  evaluation  research  conducted  in  prison  settings  during  this  same  review period. Appendix Table 7B includes nine level 3 and two level 2 quasi-experiments. Only three of the nine level 3 studies included recidivism measures (DiPlacido et al., 2006; Polaschek, 2011; Polaschek  et  al.,  2005);  one  of  the  two  level  2  studies  (Friendship  et  al.,  2003)  included  a recidivism measure. Finally, Appendix Table 7B includes 13 level 1 studies. While of low quality, we include them here to in an attempt to find any (and all) CBT evaluation research evidence that measures  post-release  outcomes.  Only  two  of  these  level  1  studies  included  a  post-release recidivism measure (Lester et al., 2020; and Zlotnick et al., 2003).

The  body  of  the  evaluation  research  on  the  recidivism  reduction  effects  of  CBT  programs conducted in prison settings is mixed . There is evidence from several studies that participation 4 in -and  completion  of -prison-based  CBT  programs  is  associated  with  lower  recidivism . 5 However, there were also several studies reporting either mixed effects or null effects. Due to these mixed findings, and the small number of studies conducted during our review period, we cannot offer a definitive statement on the recidivism reduction effects of CBT programs.

We do have sufficient evaluation research to assess the effectiveness of these programs on a variety of intermediate outcomes related to in-prison mental health and in-prison behavior. It is

our view that it is appropriate to classify one or more of BOP's CBT-based treatment programs as effective/evidence-based if they are found to achieve these intermediate outcomes, even though there  is  limited  high  quality  evaluation  research  available  on  their  impact  on  post-release behavior.

Absent the evaluation research findings on BOP's own programs (except for the BRAVE Program), we must rely on the results from evaluations of similar CBT programs conducted in prisons and jails.  We present our review of this body of research by grouping CBT evaluations as follows: BRAVE Program, Challenge Program and anger management; basic cognitive skills; emotional self-regulation/suicide prevention; CBT for criminal thinking; mindfulness-based CBT; and CBT for eating disorders, insomnia, or gambling.

## 7.5.1 Prison Programs Designed to Reduce Misconduct Using BRAVE and Challenge Program-based Strategies and/or Anger Management

We included nine evaluations of programs designed to reduce misconduct in prison using CBT techniques.  These  evaluation  findings  offer  research  evidence  that  can  be  applied  to  BOP's BRAVE,  Challenge,  and  Anger  Management  Programs.  Three  of  these  evaluations  were randomized control trials (Hogan et al., 2012; Vannoy and Hoyt, 2004; and Hutchinson, 2017). Only one of the three RCTs examined the impact of the program on misconduct; in this study, the results were mixed (Hogan et al., 2012). The other two RCTs included here focused on pre-post changes in scores on various anger subscales. We briefly summarize these three studies below.

Hogan et al. (2012) evaluated a program conducted in a Midwest prison called Cognitive Housing Approach: New Goals Environment (CHANGE). The CHANGE program targeted high-risk problem incarcerated individuals requiring higher security. According to the rese arch team, ' Phase I was designed to last 6 to 8 weeks with participants attending 2-hour sessions twice weekly. Groups consisted  of  six  to  eight  inmates  that  were  facilitated  by  two  trained  staff  members,  one  a correctional officer and the other a case manager. Basic concepts and techniques of cognitive change were introduced describing what cognitive self-change was and how thinking errors affect attitudes, beliefs, and thinking patterns' (2012, 376). To assess program effectiveness, official misconduct reports were compared at 3-months and 6-months after completion of phase 1, the program's required component. There were no statistically significant differences in misconduct rates between the treatment and control groups at either follow-up point. However, there were differences in violent misconduct reports at the 6-month follow-up point.

Vannoy and Hoyt (2004) conducted their modest RCT at a low security Midwestern prison. The study sample was very small; there were 16 subjects in the treatment group and 15 in the waiting list control group. According to the researchers, 'An anger therapy intervention was developed

for incarcerated adult males. The therapy [12-week program, one 1.5-hour session each week] was  an  extension  of  cognitive-behavioral  approaches,  incorporating  principles  and  practices drawn from Buddhist psychology' (2004, 39). Rather than look at the impa ct of the program on institutional misconduct, the researchers conducted pre-post comparisons of scores on scales measuring both anger and empathy. The treatment group performer better than the control group for '3 of the 5 state and trait anger subscales' (2004, 50).

Hutchinson and colleagues (2017) conducted a small, multi-site RCT of an anger management program operating in four Caribbean prisons on the island of Trinidad. There was a total of 85 participants  (59  in  treatment  group,  26  in  the  control  group).  Researchers  noted  that  the participants in this study included men, women, and male young adult incarcerated individuals: 'Participants were recruited from among inmates in four prisons in Trinidad: a (male) maximum security  prison,  male  and  female  general  prisons ,  and  a  (male)  young  offenders'  institution' (2017, 3). The intervention included 12 two-hour sessions using a manualized anger management program originally designed for individuals with mild intellectual disabilities. Following the same measurement  strategy  as  Vannoy  and  Hoyt  (2004),  no  outcome  data  were  collected  on  the impact of this program on institutional misconduct. The effectiveness of the anger management program was measured by pre-post comparisons of score on selected scales measuring anger (state  anger,  trait  anger,  and  anger  expression),  using  a  4-month  post  program  follow-up. Significant  improvement  in  anger  coping  skills  was  reported,  among  participants  in  the experimental group with no changes in the control group. Unfortunately, pre-post comparisons were only available for 57 of the 85 program participants, reducing the size of the experimental and control groups even more (41 treatment vs. 16 controls).

We also reviewed the findings from 4 quasi-experimental studies (Innes, 2000; Polaschek, 2011; Polaschek, 2005; and Spiropoulos et al., 2005). As we noted earlier in the chapter, the Innes study focused on the impact of the BRAVE Program on misconduct; positive results were reported for this BOP Program, but post-release recidivism was not measured. However, other researchers have looked at post-release outcomes.

The two evaluations conducted by Polaschek and colleagues (2005, 2011) examined the impact of  an  intensive  cognitive  behavioral  rehabilitation  program  targeting  violent  men  in  New Zealand's  Rimutaka  violence  prevention  unit.  The  program  consisted  of  330  ho urs  of  group sessions over 28 weeks. The researchers described the program as follows: 'it was cognitive -behavioral  and  modular,  with  content  that  covered  (a)  identifying  individual  risk  factors  by examining  index  offense  chains,  (b)  offense-supportive  thinking,  (c)  mood  management,  (d) victim empathy, (e) moral reasoning, (f) problem solving, (g) communication and relationship skills, and (h) plan for post release risk management' (2011, 668). They used reconviction during a 3.5-year follow-up period as their primary outcome measure. In their 2011 study, the post-

release reconviction rates of 112 men in the treatment group were compared to a matched control  group  (n=112).  For  both  completers  and  non-completers  of  this  program,  overall reconviction  rates  are  very  high  (83%  for  treatment  completers;  93%  for  non-completers). However, they fared better than a matched control group on both the any reconvictions and the violent  reconviction  measures.  There  was  no  difference  between  the  treatment  and  control group  for  the  subgroup  of  participants  who  did  not  complete  the  program.  Overall  effects combining all participants were not presented. Finally, the researchers argued that 'the program was more effective  with  high-risk  than  medium-risk  men,  confirming  correctional  policy  that denied men with less than a 40% risk of ser ious reconviction referral to the program' (2011,675).

The findings presented in the 2011 evaluation of the program were generally consistent with the findings  from  an  earlier,  much  smaller  evaluation  of  the  same  program  by  these  authors (Polaschek  et  al.,  2005).    In  the  earlier  study,  22  program  participants  who  completed  the program were compared to a matched sample of 60 non-participants. No statistically significant differences between treatment and control groups were found using the any reconviction or return to prison outcome measures (minimum 2-year post-release follow-up). However, they reported that 'The rate of violent failure was significantly different, with 32% of the treatment group being reconvicted for a violent offense after release compared to 63% of the comparison group (t = 2.6, p = .015)' (2005 , 1619).

The  final  quasi-experiment  we  reviewed  in  this  area  was  conducted  by  Spiropoulos  and colleagues (2005). The outcome measure of interest in this evaluation was prison misconduct. The evaluation includes assessments of two separate programs: Problem Solving and Pathfinders. The Problem-Solving program is relatively short in duration (4-5 half hour sessions) compared to other cognitive behavioral programs, which typically run for 3-4 months. In this program,  'Offenders  are  taught  to  stop  and  think,  identify  th e  problem  and  goal,  gather information and insight, indicate the choices and consequences of those choices, choose a course of action, plan this course of action, do this course of action, and evaluate the result' (2005, 75). The Pathfinders program is longer in  duration,  with 200 hours  of instruction over 4 months. According to the research team, 'Its focus on relationships and empowerment, however, brings it  closer  to  needs  outlined  for  women  offenders  than  the  typical,  offender-based,  cognitivebehavioral  program.  This  program  highlights  the  acceptance  of  differences  among  group members, the need for effective communication and trust, the importance of self-image and clarity of thinking, and the enhancement of moral values and empowerment' (2005, 75). For both men and women, the problem-solving group did better than the matched control group based on measures of psychological improvement, and prison misconduct. However, the findings reported here suggest that these two programs may have different effects on men and women. Treatment vs control group comparisons revealed that the problem-solving program significantly

reduced  depression  for  men  only,  while  the  Pathfinders  program  significantly  reduced depression for women participants.

One non-experimental studies (level 1 quality rating) evaluating prison-based anger management programs is also included in Appendix Table 7B (Kersten et al., 2016). This evaluation of the Start Now  Program  reported  positive  outcomes  in  terms  of  reduced  disciplinary  infractions  by participants (Kersten et al., 2016).

Our overall assessment of this group of CBT programs is that while the in-prison program effects are  promising,  the  post-release  recidivism  reduction  effects  of  these  programs  are  currently unknown.

## 7.5.2 Prison Programs Designed to Improve Basic Cognitive Skills

Appendix Table 7B includes 10 evaluations of basic cognitive skills programs , including 4 RCTs 6 (Sacks et al., 2012; Sacks et al., 2008; Brazão, 2018; Brazão, 2015a,2015b), 5 quasi-experiments (Gobbett and Sellen, 2014; Mak and Chan, 2018; DiPlacido et al., 2006; Strah et al., 2018; and Friendship et al.,2003), and 1 study using a nonexperimental design (Lester et al., 2020). Five of these evaluations included recidivism outcomes, while the remaining studies measured in-prison outcome measures (infractions, mental health).

The 4 RCTs describe two program evaluations: one study (Sacks et al.,2008) was conducted at a women's  prison,  and  it  compared  the  effects  of  a  residential  therapeutic  community  to  an outpatient  cognitive  behavioral  treatment  program;  the  other  study  (Brazão  et  al.,2018) examined the impact of the Growing Pro-Social (GPS) program (based in schema therapy) vs. the wait list control group, and it included men in Portuguese prisons, age 18-40. We describe the evidence of the effectiveness of both programs below.

Sacks  and  colleagues  studied  the  effects  of  two  different  programs  designed  to  address  the problems  of  women  in  prison  who  have  substance  use  disorders:  a  therapeutic  community program called Challenge to Change , and the prison's existing cognitive behavioral intervention. The  study  setting  for  the  randomized  control  trial  (RCT)  was  a  women's  prison  in  Denver,

Colorado. The research team published their preliminary findings in 2008, and then provided a more detailed presentation of evaluation findings in 2012. According to the research team, 'Over two thirds of study subjects received a lifetime diagnosis of severe mental disorder, nearly onehalf received a diagnosis of PTSD, and virtually all reported exposure to trauma' (2008, 233). The outpatient cognitive behavioral change program was a 15-week course (2 days per week for 2 hours) that was completed in approximately 6-9 months. The Challenge to Change therapeutic community was a residential program, where participants stayed for an average of 6.5 months. In their preliminary evaluation, only 6-month post-release follow-up data were presented. The two groups showed similar improvement in mental health and substance use (no statistically significant differences between groups), but the Challenge to Change program participants had significantly lower rearrest rates (26% vs. 35%) than the participants in the cognitive behavioral program.

In their 2012 study, similar mental health outcomes were reported using a 12-month follow-up period, but there was no longer a statistically significant difference in re-arrests at the 12-month post-release point. However, the researchers reported a higher re-incarceration rate (18% vs 13%).  Interpretation  of  these  findings  will  vary  depending  on  which  recidivism  measure  is preferred recidivism reduction effects are based on the re-arrest criterion, then both programs had the same effect; if return to prison is the preferred metric, then the Challenge to Change program would be described as the more effective of the two interventions.

Brazão and colleagues conducted a randomized control trial (RCT) to assess the Growing ProSocial (GPS) program being offered in several Portuguese prisons. The program is described as a 'structured  and  manualized  group  program  grounded  in  schema  theory 7 and  intervention methods…. [which] can be used as a first choice cognitive -behavioral program (to be delivered a  few  months  after  prison  intake)  along  with  other  group  and/or  individual  interventions programs addressing specific criminogenic needs. (Brazão et al., 2018, 58). The program was delivered by two therapists trained in schema therapy and cognitive-behavioral techniques; it included  forty  90-minute  sessions  offered  weekly.  A  group  of  adult  males,  age  18-40  were randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups. Treatment group participants attended the  GPS  program  for  12  months  and  received  treatment  as  usual  (TAU);  the  control  group participants received treatment as usual (TAU) only. They did not attend any other structured

intervention  during  the  research  period.  Findings  from  this  RCT  focused  only  on  in-prison outcomes.  GPS  program  participants  were  found  to  have  significantly  fewer  disciplinary infractions than their control group counterparts, not only during the program, but also during a 12-month follow-up period (while still incarcerated). The GPS group also showed improvement in  several  adjustment  measures,  while  the  control  group  showed  either  no  change  or  lower adjustment scores.

Based on these two experiments, there is high quality empirical evidence of the in-prison effects of participation in both CBT programs, but we can offer no definitive assessment of post-release recidivism reduction effects of either program. Two of the five quasi-experiments do attempt to measure  post-release  recidivism  outcomes.  Both  studies  report  that  participation  in  CBT programs was linked to lower post-release recidivism (DiPlacido et al., 2006; Friendship et al., 2003).

DiPlacido  et  al.  (2006)  conducted  a  quasi-experimental  evaluation  of  high-intensity  cognitive behavioral programs 8  operating at the Regional Psychiatric Centre in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, a maximum-security forensic mental health hospital that takes referrals from other correctional institutions. While the focus of this study was on gang members, non-gang members were also included.  Both  treated  gang  members  and  treated  non-gang  members  were  compared  to  a matched group of gang and non-gang members that were not in these programs 9 . While small sample size (n=40 in each of 4 groups) was noted as a study limitation, the researchers reported significant  differences  between  treatment  and  control  groups  in  both  major  institutional infractions and post-release recidivism (using reconviction and violent reconviction during a 2year  follow-up),  with  larger  effects  for  gang  members  than  non-gang  members.  However, because  of  the  nature  of  the  retrospective  research  design  used,  and  the  selection  of  the comparison group, we are not confident in the accuracy of the findings reported in this study.

A  second  quasi-experimental  study  of  two  CBT  programs  with  post-release  outcomes  was conducted in the United Kingdom by Friendship et al. (2003). The two programs under review

were the Reasoning &amp; Rehabilitation program 10 , and Enhanced Thinking Skills 11 .  Results  offer tentative support for these two CBT programs. Researchers report that participation in both CBT programs reduce recidivism risk substantially; the research team estimates that there was a '55% reduction in the chances of being reconvicted within 2 years after discharge for R&amp;R and a 52% reduction for ETS' (Friendship et al, 2003, 109).  However, further examination of the data by risk level  provided  support  for  the  use  of  CBT  programs  for  'medium  risk'  individuals  only;  no significant  differences  were  noted  for  either  the  high  risk  or  low  risk  participants  of  these programs. The authors note that, 'For medium risk offenders, the percentage point reduction in recidivism  was  14%,  and  for  medium-high  risk  offenders  there  was  an  11-percentage  point reduction' (Friendship et al, 2003, 110). Unfortunately, the researchers point out that even after matching, significant differences still were present between treatment and control groups, which is the reason for the study's level 2 rating in design qu ality.

While both quasi-experiments report positive results for CBT programs in terms of recidivism reduction, these two studies have design flaws that limit their consideration as evidence for the purposes  of  this  review.  At  this  point,  we  have  one  RCT  with  mixed  effects,  and  two  quasiexperiments -of  limited  quality -that  report  significant  recidivism  reduction  effects.  This research base is insufficient, leading to our classification of the recidivism reduction effects of these programs as unknown .

Four  of  the  quasi-experimental  evaluations  of  CBT  programs  included  in  Appendix  Table  7B measure  in-prison  outcomes,  with  two  studies  (DiPlacido,  et  al,  2006;  Strah,  et  al.,  2018) examining the impact of CBT on institutional behavior (i.e., infractions, misconduct), and two studies (Gobbett &amp; Sellen, 2014; Mak &amp;Chan, 2018) examining the impact of CBT on in-prison mental health outcomes. The results for the impact of CBT on infractions was mixed: DiPlacido

et al. (2006) reported significantly lower rates of major institutional infractions in the treatment group compared to the control group, there were no differences found for minor infractions. Strah and colleagues (2018) found no differences in infractions between treatment and control groups.

All four studies provide support for the effectiveness of CBT programs. When combined with the findings from the two RCTs, we have sufficient evidence to rate these programs as effective / evidence-based programs in terms of their in-prison effects on mental health, but not for prison misconduct.

## 7.5.3 Prison Programs Designed to Improve Emotional Self-Regulation

Appendix Table 7B includes seven studies that examine prison and jail programs designed to improve emotional self-regulation. In this area, we reviewed two randomized control trials, two quasi-experiments, and three studies with non-experimental designs. Only one of these studies included a recidivism measure, but the presentation of the recidivism findings was incomplete 12 and  cannot  be  used  to  inform  our  assessment  of  the  program's  recidivism  reduction  effect (Khudayarifard et al., 2010). Based on the available evaluation research, the recidivism reduction and infraction/misconduct reduction effects of programs designed to address emotional selfregulation are rated unknown . However, a review of these evaluations does reveal support for these programs as effective /evidence-based in terms of their impact on the in-prison mental health of program participants.

## 7.5.4 Prison Programs Designed to Address Criminal Thinking

Appendix  Table  7B  includes  four  studies  that  examine  the  effects  of  programs  designed  to address  criminal  thinking,  including  one  RCT  of  a  Thinking  for  a  Change  (TFAC)  program conducted in three Ohio prisons (LaPlante et al., 2021), three quasi-experimental examining the

TFAC program (Bickle,  2013;  Berman,  2005;  and  Walters,  2017),  and  one  study  using  a  nonexperimental design (Folk et al., 2016).

LaPlante et al. (2021) conducted a randomized control trial in three Ohio state prison settings: 2 high security prisons and 1 medium/low security facilities. Rather than test the efficacy of the Thinking for A Change (TFAC) program, researchers focused on whether the TFAC model is more effective in a traditional classroom setting than via video conference with co-facilitation by other incarcerated individuals. Effectiveness was measured by comparing pretest and post-test scores on a self-report questionnaire designed to social problem-solving skills. Due to small sample size, the results reported by researchers should be viewed as preliminary. No differences were found between  groups  at  each  of  the  three  locations;  significant  improvements  in  social  problemsolving skills were found for both groups. The research also noted the following: 'On average, significant improvements accrue to participants who receive greater program dosage. However, program  completion, commonly  viewed  as  a primary marker of satisfactory program performance,  is  not  associated  with  improvement  in  social  problem  solving'  (2021,  832). Although the researchers discussed the potential impact of the TFAC program on misconduct, data were not reported on this potential outcome measure.

Prior to LaPlante and colleague's RCT, Bickle (2013) conducted a preliminary assessment of Ohio's TFAC  program,  using  a  quasi-experimental  design.  There  were  differences  between  the  two groups on several items, including gender, age, and risk level, that represent a significant design limitation.  Two  scales -the  Social  Problem-Solving  Inventory-Revised  and  the  TCU  Criminal Thinking Scales -were  administered to a group of TFAC participants (n=748), and a  wait-list comparison  group  (n=956).  While  there  were  no  differences  between  the  TFAC  group  and comparisons  on  the  pretest  scores  for  the  SPSI-R  scale,  there  were  significant  differences between groups on pretest scores for five of seven TCI Criminal Thinking subscales. Changes in scale scores were examined pre-post for both groups, controlling for differences between groups. Significant  differences  in  social  problem-solving  skills  and  criminal  thinking  were  identified, providing  evidence  in  support  of  this  program 13 .  We  agree  with  the  researcher  that  despite research design limitations, 'The results of this evaluation indicate that prisoners who complete

the Thinking for a Change program experience a significant improvement in the two major foci of the program: social problemsolving skills and criminal thinking errors' (Bickle, 2013, 18).

A second  quasi-experiment  evaluated  the  effects of a CBT  program -Reasoning  and Rehabilitation  (R&amp;R) -designed  to  address  criminal  thinking  among  a  sample  of  individuals incarcerated  in  Sweden's  prison  system  (Berman,  2005).  According  to  the  author  of  th e evaluation, 'The R&amp;R program is based on social learning theory which posits that offenders have neglected to acquire basic cognitive and social skills necessary for resolving life problems in prosocial ways. The program therefore teaches participants problem solving, social skills including negotiation,  managing  emotions,  creative  thinking,  value  analysis  and  critical  thinking,  all according to a detailed manual. Facilitators deliver the program in pairs over a period of three months in 36 two-hour sess ions that emphasize active participation' (Berman, 2005, 86). Positive R&amp;R program effects were reported both for in-prison outcomes (pro-social changes in several targeted areas related to criminal thinking), and post-release recidivism. However, the use of a non-equivalent comparison group (and small sample) for the in-prison outcome portion of the evaluation  limits  our  confidence  in  this  phase  of  the  evaluation.  In  addition,  the  positive recidivism  reduction  findings  only  applied  to  individuals  completing  the  R&amp;R  program;  the recidivism rates of program dropout (23% of the 372 participants) were indistinguishable from the comparison group.

We also reviewed a third quasi-experimental study, but it had a very low design quality ranking (see  Appendix  Table  7B for  details).  Walters'  2017  quasi -experimental  evaluation  of  a  brief cognitive  behavioral  intervention  targeting  criminal  thinking -a  10-week  program  called Lifestyle  Issues -identified  positive  changes  in  various  measures  of  criminal  thinking  after completion of the program, which resulted in significantly lower levels of disciplinary infractions in the Lifestyle Issues group when compared to a nonequivalent control group. Walters reported that' Prisoners who displayed a drop in GCT scores between pre-test and post-test levels were significantly more likely to show a reduction in prison misconduct, whereas prison misconduct was likely to escalate among those who displayed a rise in criminal thinking scores from pre-test to posttest' (2017, 457). However, this study only provides preliminary evidence of the effects of  the  intervention  on  219  men  in  a  prison  in  the  Northeast,  due  to  the  use  of  a  small, nonequivalent control group. We agree with the study author's assessment: 'Greater certainty about the relative change between intervention and comparison groups can only be achieved with a more sophisticated quasiexperimental design than was possible in the current study' (Walters, 2017, 465).

Finally,  the  one  non-experimental  study  we  reviewed  in  this  subject  area  offered  additional support for programs designed to address criminal thinking errors. Folk et al. (2016) examined the  impact  of  the Taking  a  Chance  on  Change (TCC)  program,  a  self-administered  cognitive

behavioral intervention targeting criminal thinking, that was evaluated using a sample of 273 individuals in restrictive housing units in six correctional facilities in Maryland. Folk et al. (2016) noted  that  'The  purpose  of  TCC  is  to  address  cognitive  and behavioral  deficits,  as  well  as challenges common among individuals in long-term restrictive housing such as impulse control, anger,  emotion  regulation,  effective  communication,  goal-setting,  and  longterm  planning.' (275). They reported small to moderate improvements (pre-post comparisons, no control group) in criminal thinking, along with significant decline in disciplinary infractions for a subgroup of 48 individuals who completed the program. According to additional analyses by the research team, 'Reductions in reactive criminal thinking predicted reductions in disciplinary infractions' (Folk et al., 2016, 272). Due to the nature of the nonexperimental research design, combined with the fact that outcome data were only collected for 24.4% of the study participants, these preliminary findings -while interesting -do not provide the type of research evidence we need to fully assess this program.

Based on our review of these five evaluations--one RCT, three quasi-experiments, and one nonexperimental  study--we  rate  the  in-prison  impact  of  programs  targeting  criminal  thinking  as effective /evidence-based, while we rate the post-release recidivism reduction effects of these programs as unknown .

## 7.5.5 Prison Programs Using Mindfulness-based CBT

Appendix Table 7B includes two studies 14 that report the results of mindful-based CBT programs (Umbach et al., 2018; and Maroney et al., 2021). Umbach and colleagues conducted a clustered randomized control trial to answer two research questions: (1) 'Does time spent incarcerated result in deficits in emotion recognition, cognitive control, and emotion regulation as measured by an emotional go/no-go task? (2) Does CBT/MT protect against incarceration-related cognitive deficits?'  (2017,  370).  The  target  population  for  this  study  included  youth  aged  16 -18 incarcerated at the Rikers correctional facility in New York City in 2009 and 2010. Although an adult  population (18+) was not included, we  briefly summarize the results of the study  here because of the limited high-quality research conducted in this area on adult prison populations. The  researchers  found  evidence  to  support  the hypothesis  (research question  1) that

incarceration is associated with cognitive decline over a 4-month prepost period: 'We found that  incarceration  was  associated  with  significant  declines  in  specific  aspects  of  executive functioning' (2018, 46). However, there was little evidence from this study that the mindfulness program reduced cognitive deficits (research question 2). One possible explanation for this 'lack of  effects'  finding  was  that  the  control  group  also  received  treatment 15 .  According  to  the research team, 'With regard to the effects of CBT/MT, institutional constraints dictated an active control group. Thus, it is plausible that a true control group, and one more representative of the lack  of  actual  programming  available  in  this  facility  (e.g.,  a  waitlist  comparison),  would  have deteriorated even more significantly, providing a clearer measurement of both the effects of incarceration  on  cognition  and  the  potentially  protective  effects  of  CBT/MT.  We  further acknowledge the limitation that the intervention did not improve cognitive functioning, as has been  seen  in  community  samples  (Diamond  &amp;  Lee,  2011),  but  merely  limited  the  decline' (Umbach et al., 2018, 48).

The second study we reviewed that tested the effects of a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy program  in  prison  was  Maroney  et  al.'s  2021  evaluation  of  an  8 -week  mindfulness-based cognitive therapy program conducted in a male prison in the United Kingdom. The authors of the nonexperimental  study  concluded  that  this  initial  program  audit  offered  an  initial  'proof  of concept' and that this program should be offered in the UK prison system. They reported that' At the end of 8 weeks, levels of depression and anxiety were reduced while mindfulness scores had increased, suggesting that mindfulness helped participants cope with difficult feelings and sensations'  (2021,  196).  Despite  these  claims,  the  study  cannot  be  used  to  assess  the effectiveness  of  the  mindfulness-based  cognitive  behavioral  program  under  review,  due  to research design limitations.

Based on the limited research currently available, we rate the effects of mindfulness-based CBT programs as unknown .

## 7.5.6 Prison Programs Using a Circle of Strength Program Model

As we noted in our Circle of Strength program description, the target population for this program is not the general BOP population: The program was developed within the BOP. The goal of the program is to offer support and guidance to individuals in short-term placements with cognitions, mental health and/or trauma needs; however, an individual does not have to present with one of these needs to participate in the program. We did not identify any evaluations of similar, shortterm treatment programs with this target population. Our rating for this program's effects is unknown .

## 7.5.7 Prison Programs Using CBT for Eating Disorders, Insomnia, or Gambling

Program  developers  looking  for  evaluation  research  on  the  effectiveness  of  CBT  for  eating disorders, insomnia, and/or gambling can find several systematic, evidence-based reviews of CBT programs conducted in community or hospital settings. 16 These reviews offer an overall positive review of the effectiveness of CBT-based programs for each of these problems. However, there is very little research on the effectiveness of CBT programs in prison settings. Appendix Table 7B includes  only  two  level  1,  nonexperimental  studies  in  this  topic  area:  Randall  et  al.'s  2018 evaluation of a CBT intervention for 30 adult prisoners in a UK prison with insomnia symptoms, and Nixon et al.'s 2006 evaluation of a psycho -educational gambling program conducted among adult prisoners in Alberta, Canada. Both studies reported positive findings. We found no prisonbased CBT interventions for eating disorders. Due to the lack of quality evaluation research on the  effectiveness  of  CBT  for  prisoners  with  insomnia,  gambling  problems,  and/or  eating disorders, we rate these program effects as unknown .

## 7.6 CBT Programs for Mental and Behavioral Disorders Comparability Assessment

As  noted  above,  the  BRAVE  Program  has  been  evaluated  within  the  BOP.  While  the  BRAVE Program has remained the same in terms of program staffing, organization, and much of the

program content, the dosage of the program was reduced by 3 months following completion of the program evaluation (Innes, 2000). Minor changes were also made to the program curriculum, although the CBT focus remained, and the MTC model was more fully integrated into the program as well. For these reasons, we identify the BRAVE Program as comparable to its previous iteration in the BOP, but not identical, i.e., very comparable. The New Zealand programs evaluated by Polaschek  et  al.  (2005)  and  Polaschek  (2011)  and  the  CHANGE  Program  evaluated  by Hogan (2012)  appear  very  similar  to  the  BRAVE  and  Challenge  Programs  in  terms  of  their  target population,  organization,  curriculum,  and  dosage.  These  similarities  support  a  comparable finding for these evaluations as well.

Regarding  the  BOP's  Anger  Management  Program,  the  Trinidad -based  anger  management program evaluated by Hutchinson et al. (2017) and the anger management program in a low security Midwestern prison evaluated by Vannoy &amp; Hoyt (2004) appear most consistent with the BOP's model of low dosage, nonresidential, CBT -based interactive groups. When we consider the full  complement  of  anger  management  programs  evaluated  in  other  jurisdictions,  the  BOP's Anger Management Program is only somewhat comparable due to substantive differences in program dosage.

The Start Now Program evaluated by Kersten et al. (2016) is consistent with the BOP's Start Now Program; both programs apply the protocol developed by the University of Connecticut Health Sciences Center. However, the methodological weaknesses of this evaluation did not allow us to draw any conclusions about the program's effectiveness. Therefore, no comparability analysis was warranted for this program.

Program  dosage  i mpacts  the  comparability  of  the  BOP's  core  CBT  programming -  the  Basic Cognitive Skills, Criminal Thinking, and Emotional Self-Regulation Programs. Based on its limited dosage (i.e., 24 hours of programming), the BOP's Brief Cognitive Skills Program is only somewhat comparable to programs evaluated in other jurisdictions. While many of the same concepts are addressed  within  the  BOP's  program,  the  dosa ge  is  less,  with  external  programs  offering  a substantially higher treatment dose, i.e., 40-100 programming hours. For this reason, we can only classify  the  BOP's  program  as  somewhat  comparable. However,  as  noted  in  the  program description, the Brief Cognitive Skills Program is designed to serve as a pre-requisite for both the Emotional  Self-Regulation  Program  and  the  Criminal  Thinking  Program.  If  we  consider  these programs in tandem with one another, as noted below, they are comparable to a larger pool of evaluated programs in other jurisdictions.

As a standalone program, the BOP's Emotional Self -Regulation Program is comparable to the Iranian CBT program evaluated by Khodayarifard et al (2010) in terms of its target population, curriculum,  and  dosage.  When  paired  with  the  Basic  Cognitive  Skills  Pr ogram,  the  BOP's

Emotional  Self-Regulation  Program  is  comparable  with  the  more  intensive  Growing  Prosocial Program as evaluated by Brazão et al. (2015(a), 2015(b), 2018). As a stand-alone program, the BOP's Criminal Thinking Program is comparable to criminal thinking error -based CBT interventions evaluated by several researchers in our review (Gobbett &amp; Sellen, 2014; LaPlant et al.,  2021;  Walters,  2017).  These  non-residential  programs  consist  of  low  dosage,  CBT-based interventions  aimed  at  criminal  thinking  errors.  When  paired  with  the  Basic  Cognitive  Skills Program, the BOP's Criminal Thinking Program is also comparable with more intensive CBT -based programs aimed at criminal thinking errors as evaluated by Friendship et al. (2003) and Berman (2005).

Although  available  research  did  not  allow  us  to  determine  program  effectiveness,  the  BOP's Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy Program does appear to be quite similar to the programs evaluated by Dafoe &amp; Stermac (2013), Maroney et al. (2021), and Unbach et al. (2017).

Finally , we found very little research related to the BOP's three other programs in this category -CBT for Eating Disorders, CBT for Insomnia, and CBT for Prison Gambling. For the two studies we identified, neither evaluated program was consistent with the BOP's programming in this area with  significant  differences  in  dosage  and  administration  of  the  programs.  Consequently,  no comparability analysis was conducted.

## 7.7 CBT Programs for Mental and Behavioral Disorders Recommendations

BOP programs in this  chapter  address  both  behavioral  and  mental  disorders.    We  begin  our recommendations  with  programs  targeting  behavioral  disorders -the  BRAVE,  Challenge, Criminal Thinking, Anger Management, Start Now, and CBT for Prison Gambling Programs. The BRAVE,  Challenge,  and  Criminal  Thinking  Programs  seek  to  directly  reduce  criminality  and misconduct, and the Anger Management and CBT for Prison Gambling Programs seek to reduce the likelihood of inappropriate aggression, prohibited acts of gambling (and associated financial motivations  to  commit  crimes)  thereby  indirectly  reducing  the  likelihood  of  criminality  and misconduct.

Given the promising findings related to the BRAVE Program's effectiveness, the recent decision to expand the program has merit. As a high dosage CBT-based intervention, the program has the potential  to  address  high  risk  treatment  needs  more  effectively  than  the  significantly  lower dosage  Criminal  Thinking  Program  (Bourgon  &amp;  Armstrong,  2005;  Makarios  et  al.,  2014;  and Sperber et al., 2013).  In addition to addressing cognitions, the BRAVE Program appears to be one of  a  small  number  of  BOP  programs  targeting  antisocial  peers  absent  a  co-occurring  mental disorder, substance use disorder, or sexual offense. Consequently, the BOP may want to continue to expand the availability of this program, particularly if the ongoing evaluation finds continued

support for the program. In our review, t he BOP's BRAVE and Challenge Programs are both rated as promising in terms of intermediate outcomes, offering a significant treatment dosage ideally suited for medium and high risk individuals. The current evaluation of the BRAVE Program, and the upcoming evaluation of the Challenge Program, will further inform the BOP's understanding of the effectiveness of these programs, to include their recidivism reduction potential.

The  BOP  might  benefit  from  tracking  participation  in  component  parts  of  the  BRAVE  and Challenge Programs, with the view each module has some degree of value. That is, a basic CBT protocol and criminal thinking protocol are offered in a wide range of programs, and they are also offered as standalone programs. It would be helpful to track participation in these protocols more widely.  When an  integrated  program  is  completed,  the  BOP  could  note  completion  of relevant individual components. This might be helpful from a treatment planning perspective as well, so new treatment providers could easily note whether an individual is familiar with these core intervention concepts in the BOP.

Lower risk individuals can benefit from less intensive services, but research suggests a substantial treatment dosage is still needed to elicit change. The BOP's Basic Cognitive Skills Program offers a relatively low dose intervention of 24 hours, which may not be sufficient in this regard. As this program is currently under evaluation by Rutgers University, the BOP will gain a better sense of its effectiveness as a standalone intervention.

The Basic Cognitive Skills Program is often paired with one of two other programs in the BOP the Criminal Thinking and Emotional Self-Regulation Programs. As a stand-alone program, the Criminal  Thinking  Program  is  also  a  small  dose  intervention,  consisting  of  only  27  hours  of treatment;  however,  the  Basic  Cognitive  Skills  Program  is  considered  a  prerequisite  for  the Criminal Thinking Program, and under this model a program dosage of 51 hours is provided. To reach  a  target  dosage  of  100  hours,  the  BOP  might  augment  programming  with  additional sessions of skills practice. Research by Sperber and Lowenkamp (2017) has noted the addition of skills practice, e.g., role plays, to CBT interventions adds value to programming. In addition, in their 2005 meta-analysis, Landenberg and Lipsey (2005) noted value may be added by increasing the  number  of  sessions  per  week,  which  deviates  from  the  BOP's  typical  approach  to nonresidential CBT interventions. One approach to increasing dosage would be to add weekly skills practice sessions to the protocol. At a minimum, the BOP should consider combining the Basic Cognitive Skills and Criminal Thinking Programs into a single, two-phase intervention to ensure a minimum treatment dosage of 50 hours.

In a similar vein, the BOP's Anger Management Program may lack the dosage level required for effectiveness, as suggested in the work of Howells et al. (2005) and Heseltine et al. (2010).  As with the Criminal Thinking Program, additional skills practice sessions may enhance program

effectiveness.  As  the  Anger  Management  Program  is  currently  under  evaluation  by  Texas Christian University, the BOP will soon have a better sense of its effectiveness. If the program's current model is not supported, the addition of skills practice sessions may have merit.

Given the struggles with gambling in prison and its impact on institutional misconduct, the CBT for Prison Gambling Program may be somewhat underutilized. In a 2012 survey of correctional staff  and  incarcerated  individuals, McEvoy  &amp;  Spirgen  noted  'When  asked  if  they  thought relationships between inmates are harmed by gambling, 66% of inmates and 87% of CO/Staff said 'yes.' These responses, in part, reflect a realistic understanding of the risks associated with generating debts in a predatory environment and violent confrontations.' These findings suggest there is merit in identifying and implementing an appropriate intervention for prison gambling. Surveys of staff may aid in identifying the reasons the program is not widely offered at present. Of course, ev aluating this program's effectiveness is a first necessary step to encouraging broader implementation.  If the program proves to be effective, the BOP might encourage higher rates of participation  by  mandating  the  program  when  an  individual  receives  an  incident  report  for gambling  and/or  by  offering  the  individual  an  opportunity  to  expunge  an  incident  report  for gambling if they successfully complete the program. This program might also be considered as meeting a financial need, if an individual's failure t o meet their financial obligations is associated with a gambling problem.

Over the course of the past year, the BOP has significantly expanded the availability of the Start Now Program. At the close of FY 2022, there were 118 individuals participating in the program; today, there are more than 800 individuals participating in the program. One reason for this increase appears to be the  BOP 's  decision  to  make  the  program  available  to  men  as  well  as women. While we did not identify significant empirical support for this program, it does merit further  review.  Designed  specifically  for  a  criminal  justice  population,  this  program  may ultimately prove to be a better approach to applying dialectical behavior therapy principles in a correctional setting. As with other BOP programs, further research is needed. This program is not currently staged for evaluation, but if demand for the program remains high, the BOP should consider an evaluation.

Our  consideration  of  programs  in  this  area  has  also  identified  a  potential  gap  in  BOP's programming  efforts.  The  BOP  does  not  currently  offer  a  program  specifically  designed  for individuals with a history of interpersonal violence arrests and/or convictions, nor does the BOP identify this issue as a unique treatment need. While the Anger Management, Emotional SelfRegulation, and Start Now Programs have some applicability in this area, interpersonal violence is a complex phenomenon which often involves more than simply an inability to modulate strong emotions.  For example, power and control issues are often thought to play a significant role in these  behaviors.  A  recent  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  report  noted  42%  of  federally

incarcerated individuals have a history of violence and a Bureau of Justice Statistics report found domestic violence accounted for 21% of violent crimes (Office of the Attorney General, 2019; Truman &amp; Morgan, 2014).  These statistics suggest a sizable por tion of the BOP's population may benefit from the addition of an interpersonal violence prevention program to the BOP's FSA -approved programs.

Unfortunately, interventions for perpetrators of intimate partner violence are currently lacking in empirical  support.  Recent  research  suggests  there  may  be  benefit  in  addressing  the heterogeneity  of  this  population  by  classifying  individuals  based  on  contributing  factors  and offering differential treatment interventions based on these specific risk factors, e.g., personality disorders,  substance  abuse  (Day  et  al.,  2021;  Gover,  2011).    Specifically,  researchers  have suggested integrating empirically supported treatments for co-occurring conditions with intimate partner violence-related psychoeducational content. For example, interventions integrating this psychoeducational content with  dialectical behavior therapy and CBT-based substance abuse treatment  have  been  proposed  for  individuals  with  borderline  personality  disorders  and substance use disorders respectively (Waltz, 2003; Easton et al., 2008; Gilchrist et al., 2021). The BOP could lead the way in researching, developing, implementing, and evaluating programs to address this important need area.

At present, the Basic Cognitive Skills, Criminal Thinking, and Anger Management Programs are not required offerings at all BOP institutions; however, available needs assessment data suggests more than 50% of the population has an anger/hostility and/or cognitions need. Considering the prevalence of these needs, these programs should be offered at all BOP institutions, particularly if ongoing and planned research supports their effectiveness as treatment interventions. Shifting these  programs  from  'Priority  Practices'  to  required  practices  at  all  institutions  should  be considered to better meet identified needs in the population.

We now transition to recommendations for programs in this chapter addressing mental disorders -the  Basic  Cognitive  Skills,  Emotional  Self-Regulation,  Mindfulness-Based  Cognitive  Therapy, Circle of Strength, Brief CBT for Suicidal Inmates, CBT for Eating Disorders, and CBT for Insomnia Programs.

The Psychology Services Branch has done as excellent job selecting mental health programs with empirical support outside of corrections, but it is also necessary to ensure these programs are a good fit in a corrections environment. Of note, the BOP is currently evaluating the Brief Cognitive Skills Program and plans to evaluate the Emotional Self-Regulation Program in FY 2026. If these programs prove to be effective, the BOP may want to consider shifting these basic mental health programs from 'Priority Practices' to required practices at all institutions.

As suggested with the Basic Cognitive Skills and Criminal Thinking Programs, there may be merit in combining the Basic Cognitive Skills and Emotional Self-Regulation Programs into a single, twophase intervention to ensure a minimum treatment dosage of 50 hours.

The  Circle  of  Strength  Program  is  designed  to  provide  pre-treatment  services  for  detainees, seeking  to  reduce  the  distress  associated  with  recent  criminal  justice  involvement  and  to encourage future participation in prosocial programming. While a comparable program was not identified  in  our  literature  review,  this  program  appears  to  have  a  worthwhile  objective.  The program  provides  participants  with  an  introduction  to  13  relevant  topic  areas  (e.g.,  anger, depression, substance abuse), as well as information about independent study resources, BOP programs, and community resources in each of these areas. Although not currently scheduled for evaluation,  there  may  be  merit  in  evaluating  this  program  to  determine  if  individuals  who complete the program experience reduced incarceration-related distress and/or participate in BOP  programming  at  a  higher  rate.  The  program  curriculum  is  well-developed  and  genderresponsive, targets relevant need domains, and requires only basic group facilitation skills to implement. If the program proves to be effective, the BOP might consider expanding the program to serve newly designated individuals who may be struggling with very similar issues. Of note, this program shares similarities with the Foundation Program, a women's pre -treatment program discussed in Chapter 13 of this report. The Foundation Program is presently being evaluated by the Research Triangle Institute and Urban Institute. The results of this evaluation could in turn inform the BOP's understanding of the potential effectiveness of the Circle of Strength Program.

Several programs for individuals with mental health disorders appear to be underutilized. Most notably, Brief CBT for Individuals with Suicidal Ideation had 11 participants at the close of FY 2023, yet there are certainly more than 11 individuals BOP-wide at risk of suicide at any one point in time (BOP, 2023). A recent PSB report notes 2% of the BOP population presents with 'chronic suicide risk' ( PSB, 2023). Given this rate, it appears there should be significant demand for this program. In addition, the BOP has provided extensive training on this protocol.  Consequently, it is difficult to understand why the protocol is not widely used. Incorporating this protocol into policy  might  significantly  increase  its  use.  The  BOP  may  also  want  to  consider  surveying Psychology Services departments to determine why the protocol is not being widely used.

In addition, at the close of FY 2023 there were only 23 participants in the Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy Program, 16 participants in the CBT for Insomnia Program, and no participants in the CBT for Eating Disorders Program.  If the demand for these programs is in fact this low, the BOP may want to eliminate these programs, freeing up resources for other more in demand programs,  particularly  given  the  lack  of  identified  research  support  for  these  programs  in  a correctional setting.  At a minimum, there may be benefit in surveying staff to learn more about why these  programs  are  not  being  offered,  particularly  if  a  need  for  the  services  exists.  For

example,  Griffiths  &amp;  Hina  (2022)  reviewed  correctional  literature  on  sleep  disturbances  and noted high prevalence rates for insomnia (26.2%) and poor sleep quality (45.9%) in a Chinese prison;  poor  sleep  quality  (53.9%-77.1%)  in  Ethiopian  prisons;  poor  sleep  quality (87.7%)  in  a prison  in  Iran;  and  insomnia  disorder  (61.6%)  in  an  English  prison.  Therefore,  there  may  be benefit in retaining BOP's 'Priority Practice' model to provide staff with a database of specialized resources to consult if a unique treatment need arises, such as an individual presenting with persistent insomnia. When the demand for such services is so low agency-wide, resources might be better directed to other programming areas.

We now offer general recommendations, applicable to both types of CBT programs included in this chapter. Programs for individuals with mental and/or behavioral disorders should be clearly described  in  policy  to  ensure  staff  implement  the  programs  as  intended.  Incorporating  the programs more thoroughly into policy will ensure their availability and allow for their evaluation during the program review process. The PSB has developed very good fidelity measures for these programs,  which  could  easily  be  incorporated  into  staff  supervision  and  Program  Review Guidelines with additional policy support.

The BOP could benefit from mandating staff training related to CBT interventions. The BOP has a well-crafted  web-based  CBT  training  curriculum,  which  is  required  training  for  staff  in  some program  areas,  e.g.,  Residential  Drug  Abuse  Program,  Non-Residential  Drug  Abuse  Program. Program fidelity may be enhanced by requiring all practitioners to complete this training prior to delivering CBT programs.

The programs outlined in this section tend not to have clear completion criteria and outcome measures. Incorporating completion criteria and outcome measures into the programs would increase  program  integrity  and  suitability  for  evaluation.  For  example,  requiring  a  skills demonstration  for  the  BRAVE,  Brief  Cognitive  Skills,  Criminal  Thinking,  and  Emotional  SelfRegulation Programs has merit, such as requiring completion of an RSA which meets set criteria, presentation of the RSA to the treatment group, and the appropriate acceptance of feedback from the group.  Post-program mental health assessments might also be appropriate outcomes measures for the Emotional Self-Regulation Program, such as the GAD-7 and BDI-II. Post-program knowledge  tests  might  also  serve  as  completion  criteria  in  any  of  these  programs,  ensuring participants  understand  key  cognitive-behavioral  concepts.  Intermediate  outcome  measures associated with disciplinary records, mental health care level changes, and crisis intervention contacts could be collected and analyzed to aid in program outcome evaluations.

## 7.8 Summary of CBT Programs for Mental and Behavioral Disorders

The table below provides a summary of the results of our research review.

Six of the thirteen CBT programs for mental and behavioral disorders examined in this chapter are currently classified by BOP as EBRR Programs. Based on our review of the evaluation research conducted on these programs published between 2000 and 2022, we find support for classifying three  of  these  programs  as  EBRR  Programs:  Basic  Cognitive  Skills,  Criminal  Thinking,  and Emotional Self-Regulation, particularly when the programs are offered in tandem, i.e., the Basic Cognitive  Skills  Program  paired  with  Criminal  Thinking  Program,  or  the  Basic  Cognitive  Skills Program  paired  with  the  Emotional  Self-Regulation  Program.  We  found  support  for  the effectiveness  of  these  programs  in  terms  of  intermediate,  in-prison  outcomes,  e.g.,  reduced misconduct,  improved  institutional  adjustment,  reduced  symptoms.  In  addition,  we  found support for provisionally classifying the BRAVE, Challenge, and Anger Management Programs as EBRR  Programs,  based  on  promising  empirical  support  for  their  effectiveness  in  reducing misconduct, improving institutional adjustment, and in the case of anger management reducing symptoms. It is important to note these rankings are not based on evaluations of BOP's own programs; that body of evaluation research simply does not exist. Instead, the rankings are based on  our  review  of  evaluations  of  programs  operating  in  state  corrections  systems  across  the United States, and/or in another country's correctional system. While these programs do appear to be comparable to the BOP programs based on our comparability review, it is recommended that each of these BOP programs be independently evaluated. We understand the BOP has plans to evaluate these programs and we support this plan.

We were also asked to assess the remaining seven programs, which are currently classified as PA Programs -the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, Circle of Strength, Brief CBT for Suicidal Individuals, CBT for Eating Disorders, CBT for Insomnia, CBT for Prison Gambling, and Start Now Programs.  For  these  programs,  our  review  did  not  find  sufficient  research  to  make  any determination about their PA Program designation. Once again, the necessary research with a correctional population has not been conducted.

| 1) Auty et al.  (2017) Systematic  Review | A full range of psycho- educational programs  for reducing prison  violence.  Programs included  Moral Reconation  Therapy (MRT), Anger  Management, CHANGE,  Strategies for Thinking  Productively (STP), Skills  Training for Aggression  Control (STAC),  Alternatives to Violence  project, Dialectical  Behavior Therapy,  Resolve to Stop the  Violence Project (RSVP),  the Persistent Violent  Offender (PVO)  program, and  therapeutic community  (TC). | 1996-2016  Note: 15  studies 2000- 2016  2 studies of  juvenile  populations  included | Only evaluations  of programs  designed to  reduce violence,  with  comparison  groups, and  measures of  violence used as  outcomes | 21 evaluations met  review criteria.  Note: 5 RCTS and 16  quasi-experiments  17 studies of males,  2 studies of women,  2 studies with both  groups | No overall effects across a variety of psycho- educational interventions.  For the 5 RCTS: Incidents were lower in the  experimental groups, but the difference between  groups were not statistically significant.  For the 16 quasi-experiments: The results were  mixed, with 8 studies reported no differences in  outcomes for the treatment and comparison  groups, but the remaining studies did find  evidence of effectiveness for some of the outcome  measures. Setting matters: Of the five studies that were set  in a TC, four produced statistically significant  reductions in violence in the program group  compared to the control group (Dietz, 2003; Lee &  Gilligan, 2005; Magliner, 2013; Welsh et al., 2007). |

'Psychological treatments are generally effective  in treating anger. The results also suggest a  considerable degree of variability in the effect  sizes of specific treatments for anger. The results  show that at least some of the variability may be  explained by the number of treatment sessions  offered to participants, the use of manuals to  guide delivery of the treatment, the use of fidelity  checks, the setting of the research, and whether  the study was published or unpublished.'

Single case  studies and  qualitative  designs were  excluded.  All modalities of  CBT based  treatment for  anger or  violence  receiving  treatment in  prison or the  community.  Studies that  focused  exclusively on  domestic  violence abusers  or offenders  with mental  health diagnosis  were excluded | 13 evaluations | Overall positive findings reported with statistically  significant reductions in both general and violent  recidivism.  'The RR analysis found an overall risk reduction in  recidivism of 23% for general recidivism and 28%  for violent recidivism after treatment.

The absolute difference  between experimental and control groups was .10  (30% experimental vs 40% control). Separate  analyses of adult CBT institutional programs were  not conducted.  Researchers noted: 'The mean odds ratio  representing the average effect of intervention  was 1.53 (p<.001), indicating that the odds of  success (no recidivism in the post-intervention  interval of approximately 12 months) for  individuals in the treatment group were more than  one and a half times as great as those for  individuals in the control group. In relation to the  mean recidivism rate for the control groups of  about .40, this odds ratio indicates a recidivism  reduction of 25% to .30.' (7) |

| 1) Brazão et al.  (2018) | Study tests the efficacy of the  Growing Pro-Social (GPS)  Program. It 'tested the  program's ability to increase,  on one hand, cognitive  reappraisal (adaptive   emotion regulation strategy)  and, on the other hand,  decrease expressive  suppression  (maladaptive emotion  regulation strategy) over  time. It was also assessed if  the GPS was capable of  reducing disciplinary  infractions committed by  inmates over time.' (57) (9 Prisons in Portugal) | An independent  randomized controlled  trial with blind  assessments,  Participants were  randomized to the  GPS treatment ( n =  121) or the control  group ( n =  133). | 5 -  A well-designed RCT  with sufficient samples.  'The GPS's structure  follows a progressive  strategy of change, which  begins by: (a) increasing  knowledge about the  nature and ambiguities of  human communication,  (b) changing maladaptive  behavioral patterns in  specific interpersonal  contexts, (c) learning  about cognitive  distortions and  counteracting their  influence in the  attribution of meaning to  events, (d) experiencing  and understanding the  function and meaning of  emotions and their  influence on human  behavior, and (e) learning  about early maladaptive  schemas and fighting  against their influence on  thoughts, emotions and  behaviors. This gradual  strategy of change  requires the program to | Results demonstrated improvements in the  treatment group as measured by change over time  observed in all outcome measures. 'Concerning  emotion regulation, and for cognitive reappraisal,  while the treatment group showed a significant  increase, controls presented a decrease over time. A  different tendency was observed for expressive  suppression, that is, while the treatment group  presented a significant decrease, the control group  showed no change over time. These results support  the assumption that GPS is capable of promoting  emotion regulation, which is one of the program's  main goals.' (66) 'Concerning behavior regulation, results showed  that the number of disciplinary infractions and the  number of days in punishment significantly  decreased over time in the treatment group. In turn,  the control group showed no change or a worsening  in those same variables over time. These results  pointed out the GPS's ability to  reduce, not only  disciplinary infractions committed by inmates,  but also the number of days inmates were in  punishment. Therefore, GPS achieved the ultimate  goal of any intervention program: changing actual  behavior. Further, these outcomes were directly  observable and quantifiable, thus not relying on  self- report measurement methods.' (67) |

Those  in the CHANGE program  received the involuntary  Phase I. The outcome  criteria were the number  of misconduct reports (in  the areas of disobeying a  direct order, insolence,  violent, nonviolent, and  total number of  misconduct reports) 3  and 6 months after the  end of Phase I. The  independent variable was  whether the inmate had  participated in the  CHANGE program or not.'  (380) | ' Overall, the results suggest that the CHANGE  program had no statistically significant impact on  reducing the number of misconduct reports among  the inmates who participated in the program as  compared to the inmates who did not participate in  the program. The CHANGE program participants did,  however, show a statistically significant reduction in  violent misconducts after 6 months.' (382) 'Phase  I was designed to introduce the inmates to  different skill sets needed for changing their current  cognitive thinking processes. The length of this  phase optimally was 8 weeks, but many of the  inmates received all the lessons in a shorter time  period. it could be argued that 2 months was not  enough time for the material to "sink in" and to be  internalized into daily practice. Despite the possible  dissipation effect, it may take longer for the inmates  to grasp how to apply the material in their prison  surroundings.' (382) |

- 5 RCT with pretesting to ensure balanced group assignment. 'Upon consenting to participate, each client was pretested on a reliable and valid interviewer administered instrument that assesses how an individual approaches day-to-day problems. Some clients, for instance, may think through potential responses and weigh the costs and benefits of different alternatives, whereas others may be more likely to act impulsively.  After completion of recruitment and pretesting, the clients were randomly assigned into a treatment or control (traditional classroom) group within each trial using a stratified randomization procedure to ensure balanced group assignment. Consistent with the initial goal of studying misbehavior post-program but prior to release, the randomization procedure sought to balance groups, such that clients with
- '[T]he evidence indicates that video conferencing and inmate co-facilitation produce statistically equivalent results when compared to traditionally run classes. This finding has important implications and suggests that agencies should continue to study and experiment with modified formats of TFAC and CBT more generally, albeit cautiously. As well, the findings are potentially more relevant in the context of a pandemic and the ensuing recovery efforts, which are likely to prioritize social distancing measures and will require program modifications going forward. Supporting the efficacy of the treatment, we find that prosocial changes in problem solving do occur during the TFAC program. However, the evidence suggests those improvements are not conferred by program completion. Rather, improvements appear to accrue with an increase in program dosage. Put differently, the results suggest that some participants benefited significantly from attending several classes irrespective of whether they completed the course, and that some clients completed the course but apparently benefited less.'

(669) | Polaschek states, 'the results presented here  provide some evidence that the program had a  positive effect on reconviction risk: fewer high-risk  program completers were reconvicted for any  offense, or for a violent offense during an average of  3.5 years of post-release follow- up. Completers' first  re-offense of any kind occurred significantly more  slowly than for the matched untreated comparison  men, and the survival curve for violent reoffending  showed a similar pattern.  Furthermore, these  positive results for high-risk program completers  were not offset by the recidivism outcomes of  noncompleters. Intent-to-treat analyses - where  these men who received only a partial dose of the  treatment are treated statistically as if they  attended all of the program - also show overall  positive results.' (674) 'Non -completers were slightly higher-risk cases at  the outset. Static risk estimates - which are not  affected by program attendance or offenders'  efforts to rehabilitate themselves - show that  compared to those who completed the program,  non-completers were estimated to be 4% more  likely to reoffend seriously at the time they entered  the program. However, there is no evidence in their  actual outcomes that removal from the program - whether voluntary or enforced - further increased  their risk. Non- completers' rates  of recidivism were  similar to those of their matched untreated  comparisons.' (674) |

Assignment to the  program was not  random.   Note: Individuals who  were transferred  directly from jail to  prison were excluded  from the study, as an  evaluation of  recidivism reduction  was the focus. | 2 -  Limitations of the  study include the lack  randomization, lack of  matched controls, and  small sample size.

To assess lengths of stay  effects,  -tests were used  t to compare individuals in  the program for 8 weeks,  12 weeks, and 16 weeks  or more. | Overall, mixed findings reported for the recidivism  analyses, with no effects for overall re-arrest rates,  but significant differences between treatment and  control groups for violent re-arrests.  Individuals who participated in RSVP had lower  rearrest rates for violent crimes (-46.3%,  p <0.05 )  and spent less time in custody (-42.6T,  p <0.05).  The decline in violent re-arrests increased with  greater lengths of stay (-53.1%,  p <0.05 for 12 weeks  or more; -82.6%,  p <0.05 for 16 weeks or more.   However, weaker statistical strength was noted as  sample sizes dropped as program duration  increased, i.e., 8 week  n =101, 12 week  n =71, 16  week  n =61.  All subjects experienced a lower level of recidivism  after incarceration.  Reductions in violent recidivism  for RSVP participants were significantly greater  -  a  reduction of 66.7% v. 41% in the comparison group.   However, overall re-arrest rates were not  significantly different between the two groups. |

three major groups; those referred but not assessed, those receiving an assessment contact only and those who entered treatment as defined by two or more clinical contacts with an IAPT practitioner (minimum of one assessment and one treatment session). Using preselected values on the electronic patient management system used by the NHS service provider, the IAPT team recorded the final status of the treated group into those that completed treatment, those who dropped out of treatment, noncompleters who were moved to another prison establishment, non-completers who were released into the community and those who were found to be unsuitable during treatment and moved/signposted to a more appropriate and/or their status within the correctional system. 'This evaluation reports the outcomes of routine practice within the Lincolnshire IAPT service and therefore suffers from the lack of a control group.
