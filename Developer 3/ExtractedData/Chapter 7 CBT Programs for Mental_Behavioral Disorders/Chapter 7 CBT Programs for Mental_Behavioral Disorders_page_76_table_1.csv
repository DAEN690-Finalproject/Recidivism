controlled trial of

treatment as usual
(CBSP; n = 31)

(TAU; n = 31). The
primary outcome was
self-injurious behavior

Secondary outcomes
were dimensions of

symptomatology,
personality
dysfunction and
psychological
determinants of
suicide, including
depression and
hopelessness” (3441).","5 - RCT: The study was a
single blind (rater)
randomized controlled
pilot trial. The study
sample was recruited
from a closed institution
with capacity to house
approximately 1,200 male
prisoners.
Inclusion criteria were
male prisoners aged over
18 years, who had been
identified within HM
Prison Service’s
Assessment, Care in
Custody and Teamwork
(ACCT) (Ministry of
Justice, 2013) system as
being at risk of suicidal
behavior within the past
month. After agreement
to be contacted,
prisoners expressing an
interest in the study were
then invited to an initial
research interview to
confirm eligibility. This
process of identifying
potential participants was
conducted independently
of the research team.","“Results indicated that delivering CBSP within a
prison setting is feasible, with the majority of
patients commencing therapy and choosing to
complete the program. The CBSP therapy was found
to be associated with improvements on measures
relating to the primary outcome of self-injurious
behavior (SIB), as well as measures of psychiatric
symptomatology, but this did not generalize to
other established psychological correlates of
suicide.” (3447)
While the results are based on one pilot study, they
may be “seen as sufficiently encouraging to warrant
further investigation of the efficacy of the CBSP
intervention.” (3447)"
