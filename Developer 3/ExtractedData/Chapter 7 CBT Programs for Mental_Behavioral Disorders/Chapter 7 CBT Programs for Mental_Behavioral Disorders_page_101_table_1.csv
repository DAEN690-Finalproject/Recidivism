study show that the drama-based intervention
aimed at enhancing anger management with
offenders with a history of violence was associated
with significant improvements on all scales of

usefulness of a drama-based approach for work with
violent offenders.” (134)
“Despite positive changes, methodological
limitations need to be taken into consideration. The
single group pre/post design makes it difficult to
determine whether the results are attributable to
the drama intervention or to other factors, such as
external events or other interventions conducted
within the prison at the same time. Therefore,
interpretation of the results needs to be made with
caution.” (135)"
