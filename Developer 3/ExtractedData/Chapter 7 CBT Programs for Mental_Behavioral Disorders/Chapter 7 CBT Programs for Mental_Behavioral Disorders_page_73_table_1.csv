included in the study.
“Random assignment
was based on whether
the inmate
registration number
was odd or even; even
numbers went to the
CHANGE group and
odd numbers were the
reserve group. Each
group was housed
separately, away from
each other and
general population.
Inmates refusing to
participate in CHANGE
were segregated in a
separate block until
compliance was
obtained.” (378-9)","5 - Overall, a well-
designed RCT. “The
inmates in this study
were all identified by the
prison administration as
being eligible for
participation in the
CHANGE program. Those
in the CHANGE program
received the involuntary
Phase I. The outcome
criteria were the number
of misconduct reports (in
the areas of disobeying a
direct order, insolence,
violent, nonviolent, and
total number of
misconduct reports) 3
and 6 months after the
end of Phase I. The
independent variable was
whether the inmate had
participated in the
CHANGE program or not.”
(380)","“Overall, the results suggest that the CHANGE
program had no statistically significant impact on
reducing the number of misconduct reports among
the inmates who participated in the program as
compared to the inmates who did not participate in
the program. The CHANGE program participants did,
however, show a statistically significant reduction in
violent misconducts after 6 months.” (382)
“Phase I was designed to introduce the inmates to
different skill sets needed for changing their current
cognitive thinking processes. The length of this
phase optimally was 8 weeks, but many of the
inmates received all the lessons in a shorter time
period. it could be argued that 2 months was not
enough time for the material to ""sink in"" and to be
internalized into daily practice. Despite the possible
dissipation effect, it may take longer for the inmates
to grasp how to apply the material in their prison
surroundings.” (382)"
