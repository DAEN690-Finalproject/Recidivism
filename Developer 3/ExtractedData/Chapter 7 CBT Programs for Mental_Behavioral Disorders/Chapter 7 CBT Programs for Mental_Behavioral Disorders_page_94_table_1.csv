(669)","Polaschek states, “the results presented here
provide some evidence that the program had a
positive effect on reconviction risk: fewer high-risk
program completers were reconvicted for any
offense, or for a violent offense during an average of
3.5 years of post-release follow-up. Completers’ first
re-offense of any kind occurred significantly more
slowly than for the matched untreated comparison
men, and the survival curve for violent reoffending
showed a similar pattern. Furthermore, these
positive results for high-risk program completers
were not offset by the recidivism outcomes of
noncompleters. Intent-to-treat analyses—where
these men who received only a partial dose of the
treatment are treated statistically as if they
attended all of the program—also show overall
positive results.” (674)
“Non-completers were slightly higher-risk cases at
the outset. Static risk estimates—which are not
affected by program attendance or offenders’
efforts to rehabilitate themselves—show that
compared to those who completed the program,
non-completers were estimated to be 4% more
likely to reoffend seriously at the time they entered
the program. However, there is no evidence in their
actual outcomes that removal from the program—
whether voluntary or enforced—further increased
their risk. Non-completers’ rates of recidivism were
similar to those of their matched untreated
comparisons.” (674)"
