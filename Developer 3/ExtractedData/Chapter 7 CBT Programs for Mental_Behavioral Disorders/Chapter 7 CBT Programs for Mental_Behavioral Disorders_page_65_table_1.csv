0·92). However, after excluding smaller studies
(<50 participants in the intervention group), there
was no significant reduction in recidivism (OR
0.87, 95% CI 0·68–1·11). Based on two studies,
therapeutic communities were associated with
decreased rates of recidivism (OR 0·64, 95% CI

therapies is very limited, leading to the conclusion
that the impact of these strategies is unknown. Of
the four therapies, we have the most research (8
studies) on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
(ACT).
“ACT shows some potential promise as a
treatment with a prisoner population, but the
general lack of methodologically sound studies
greatly limits any conclusions that can be made. At
present other treatments such as Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and other third wave
therapies, most notably, Dialectical Behavior
Therapy (DBT) have accrued more evidence as a
result of greater amount of research.” (45)"
