"In addition, we decided to conduct a separate search, in the same series of databases, for anger"
management program evaluations. The following search terms were used in this second search:
anger management AND prison or jail or incarceration or imprisonment or correction
facilities NOT youths or young people or adolescents or teenagers AND recidivism or
reoffending or repeat offender.
"This search initially yielded 335 hits, with a list of 17 studies once duplicates were removed from"
the database. Visual inspection of the titles and abstracts by the research team further reduced
the number of potential studies to 7 titles meeting our initial review criteria and requiring in-
"depth review. In addition, one meta-analysis of 96 anger management programs utilizing 9"
"distinct program models (Saini, 2009) was also identified at this stage and reviewed (see"
Appendix Table 7A); only 4 of the 12 corrections studies included in this review were conducted
post-2000. This secondary search added 3 previously unidentified studies to our database.
