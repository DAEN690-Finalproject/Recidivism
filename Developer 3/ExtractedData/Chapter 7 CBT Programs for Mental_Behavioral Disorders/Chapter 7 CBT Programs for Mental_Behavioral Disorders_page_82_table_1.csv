deterioration observed in controls over a 1-year
period in variables such as anger, shame, and
paranoia, raises the question of whether traditional
prison practices work towards rehabilitation or may
be bolstering psychological and emotional processes
related to maladaptive behavior.” (230)"

Trial. Participants
were recruited from
among incarcerated
individuals in four
prisons in Trinidad: a
(male) maximum
security prison, male
and female general
prisons, and a (male)
young offenders
institution.
A total of 85 potential
participants were
randomly allocated to
one of the two
conditions (control 26;
intervention 59) and
completed some or all
of the baseline
assessments. Of these,
15 completed
outcome assessments
at Time 1 but not Time

Time 2 but not Time 1,
and 2 completed only
baseline assessments
but not Time 1 or Time
2 outcome measures.","4 - RCT design, with
variation noted in group
sizes and potentially
muted effect sizes due to
relatively small
sample/subgroup sizes.","Results suggest that anger management
interventions can be effective at reducing anger
assessed on a range of measures.
“[A] general reduction of both experience and
expression of anger was observed in participants
within the intervention group. These participants
also reported significant improvements in their
anger coping skills by the end of the intervention,
and the correlations between improvement in
coping and decreases in anger measures suggest
that the clinical improvements resulted from a
greater ability to manage anger.” (10)
“Improvements were maintained at 4-month follow-
up, but this finding is based on a very small follow-
up sample and so provides only weak evidence for a
lasting effect of the intervention. The lack of change
for individuals in the control group supports the
assertion that change was due to participation in
the intervention.” (10)"
