(2013)","Assessment of a penitentiary
relapse prevention program.
Participants were
incarcerated males who had
maximum sentences of less
than 15 years and had
already served enough time
to be eligible for an alternate
sanctioning hearing (e.g.,
reduction in facility security
level, halfway house) and/or
parole. (377)

individuals (15

participated for the
entire duration of the
study.","2 - Experimental and
comparison group with
limitation of small sample
size. The study was
initially planned with a
sample of 200 subjects
which was deemed as
ideal. The 200 subjects
would have been divided
into a control group and
experimental group using
a table of random
numbers. A number of
situational factors
prohibited the planned
design and necessitated
the study be conducted","Analyses indicate “that the Penitentiary Relapse
Prevention Program reduces fear of negative
evaluations. The reduction in the Fear of Negative
Evaluation Scale scores can be associated with
improved self-esteem, as the participants felt safer
and more confident. Valliant and Antonowics (1991)
mention an increase in self-esteem and a decrease
in anxiety in inmates who undergo Cognitive
Therapy in weekly two-hour sessions.” (380)
The control group showed modest improvements
“despite not having participated in the Penitentiary
Relapse Prevention Program. This might be because
prison is a very hostile environment and the study
gave participants the opportunity to be heard (in
the interviews, before and after the program) and to
tell their stories to people who were interested in"
