benefitted from both the therapeutic community
treatment program and the cognitive behavioral
intervention, with the trajectory of gains differing
within specific domains over short- and long-term
follow-up. The therapeutic community provided a
comprehensive model of substance abuse
treatment that integrated gender-specific
approaches and practices (e.g., positive coping
strategies for distress) that, given the strong
evidence of co-occurring mental health and trauma
needs of incarcerated women, appears to be more
effective than the standard correctional cognitive-
behavioral substance abuse treatment at improving
reincarceration rates, lengthening time in the
community before reincarceration and improving
behavioral and emotional outcomes for the women
in the 6 months after prison release.” (266)
“Furthermore, analyses of time to reincarceration,
for those women who were reincarcerated,
demonstrated that women treated in the
therapeutic community were able to remain in the
community longer than those in the control group,
which translates into cost savings for the
correctional system and into a longer period of
stability at home in the community.” (266)"
