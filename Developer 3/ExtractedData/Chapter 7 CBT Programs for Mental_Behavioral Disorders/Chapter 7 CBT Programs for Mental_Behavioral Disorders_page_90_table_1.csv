"19) Gobbett &
Sellen (2014)","Study evaluates a new
cognitive-behavioral group
intervention in UK prisons:
the Thinking Skills Program
(TSP) that aimed to develop
participant's general
cognitive skills. This study
reports on the effectiveness
of TSP using psychometric
assessments and compares
outcomes to an earlier CBT
program that was being
phased out.
(Male Prison in Wales)","Quasi- Experimental
Design. Participants in
this study were 40
adult males all of
whom were residing at
a Category B prison in
Wales. Participants
were selected on the
basis of their
attendance at TSP.
This study was
conducted at a time
when TSP was first
being implement as a
replacement for a
prior CBT program.
Results from this initial
group were compared
to previous results of
incarcerated
individuals who had
completed the older
program.
“As part of the
attendance in TSP,
participants were
required to complete","3 - No random
assignment, and a small
initial sample of TSP
program participants to
compare to subjects who
had completed the CBT
program being phased
out. “As part of their
participation, subjects
were asked to provide
consent for the
psychometric
assessments they
complete to be used for
research purposes.
Participants of this
investigation were
selected for, and
attended, therapeutic
sessions with no
knowledge that they
were to be included in
this specific
study. Participants
completed the pre-
program psychometric
assessments within 3
days prior to the first","“It was hypothesized that participants of the TSP
would show post-program improvements in their
thinking styles and attitudes, as measured by the
psychometric assessments administered. Analysis of
pre- and post-program results indicated that on 14
of the 15 psychometric scales, TSP participants
showed expected improvements in their scores
following treatment, in areas such as Impulsivity,
General Attitude to Offending, Entitlement, Power
Orientation, and Cognitive Indolence.” (468)
“The results indicate a positive impact of TSP on the
thinking styles and attitudes of those offenders who
participated. In addition, if attention is paid to effect
size analysis, TSP appears to have a positive impact
on a greater range of factors associated with
criminal thinking styles and attitudes than earlier
interventions. The results of this investigation would
suggest that among other things, TSP may assist
offenders in addressing thinking styles associated
with criminal behavior and help develop more
prosocial patterns of thinking.” (468)"
