Systematic
Review and
Meta-
Analysis",,,"Trauma-focused
interventions in prison
settings","2000-2020
All of the
studies fell
within our
review
period.","Level 2 or
higher, included
both adult and
juvenile
populations; 3
studies rated
strong, 6 studies
moderate, and 7
studies weak","16 studies:
11 studies were phase
1 interventions, & 5
included phase 2
trauma processing
components.
14 studies examined
group therapies.
14 studies used adult
and 2 studies used
juvenile samples","Small but significant overall effect size for trauma-focused
interventions in reducing PTSD and other trauma-related symptoms,
relative to control group comparisons.
Individual trauma therapies were found to be significantly more
effective at reducing trauma-related symptoms compared to group
interventions.
Phase 1 stabilization interventions were effective in reducing trauma
symptoms, but stronger effects noted in phase 2 trauma processing
interventions, based on cognitive processing therapy, NICE-
recommended trauma-focused CBT, trauma incident reduction, or
expressive trauma-based writing exercises, were more effective.",,

al. (2011)
Systematic
Review",,,"Interventions for
incarcerated women,
including risk reduction
studies (using TC for
substance abuse) that
look at recidivism
outcomes, and
enhancement studies
(using group-based CBT)
that focus on
psychological and
physical well-being.","1988-2008
Only 5
studies
conducted
post-2000
reported
trauma-
related
outcomes.","Level 1 or above
studies. Studies
including both
women and
men in sample
were included
only if separate
results for
women were
reported.","24 studies:
8 RCTs, 7 quasi-
experiments, 9 used
one-group pretest-
post-test designs.
6 risk reduction
model studies
18 enhancement
model studies
2 had outcomes for
both risk reduction
and enhancement.","9 studies included in this meta-analysis examined psychological well-
being outcomes for females (6 RCTs and 3 quasi-experiments).
Moderate effect sizes noted.
Authors reported that “overall, our systematic review showed that
women who participate in correctional-based interventions tend to
improve their psychological well-being as compared to women who
did not participate in such programs.” (25)
In terms of recidivism reduction, they found that “the three studies
with the largest demonstrated reduction in recidivism were
evaluations of prison-wide therapeutic community programs designed
to reduce substance abuse.” (27)",,

Systematic

6 RCTs
7 quasi-experiments,

this review. 12 studies found significant improvements for the
treatment group compared to the control group in depression or
depressive symptoms, PTSD, bipolar symptoms, health-related
markers, and self-esteem. 7 of these studies examined trauma-",,
