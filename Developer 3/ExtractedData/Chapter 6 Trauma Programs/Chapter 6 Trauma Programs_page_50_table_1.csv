period of 2014-2019.
A retrospective evaluation of
the effects of program
participation on behavioral
outcomes. Modeling
approaches in the study
resulted in a large number of
subjects being excluded from
aspects of the study (ranging
from excluding 488-830
subjects).
Subjects had to meet
observation criteria for 365
days pre- and post-program
participation.
Outcome measures:
misconduct, Major Psychology
Services Events (MPSEs) (e.g.,
crisis intervention, disruptive
behavior, suicide risk
assessments), restrictive
housing placements.","1 - “The first set of models
utilized conditional logistic
regression to determine if
there was a change in the
probability of any of the
outcome measures during
the post treatment risk
period. The second round of
modeling used conditional
Poisson models to determine
the extent to which change in
the number of events in the
outcome measures from pre
to post program.” (2)
Limitations: methodological
approach, large number of
excluded subjects, lack of
access to clinical outcome
measures.","“Overall, the results from the fixed effects analysis
showed support for the impact of the RTP on post
program behaviors of those who completed treatment.”

For misconduct: “…we found a 10.4% decrease on
average from pre to post program misconduct events.
However, this was not statistically significant, and we
cannot conclude there was a difference between risk
periods. The same held true for the probability model:
Although the direction of the estimated coefficient was
in the expected direction (decrease), it was not
statistically significant.” (2)
For restricted housing placements: “The estimated
coefficient from the count model was in the expected
direction and statistically significant, indicating
suggesting that the number of restrictive housing days
decreased over the observation periods. The estimated
coefficient [in] the conditional logistic model was also
significant, indicating that the odds of being placed in
SHU decreased 28.7% from the pre risk period to the
post risk period.” (2-3)
For MPSEs: “The estimated coefficient for the number of
MPSE was in the expected direction (decrease) but was
not statistically significant. As with the conditional
logistic model for SHU, the same analysis for MPSE
showed a statistically significant decrease in the odds of"
