“As an intervention designed to ameliorate PTSD
symptoms, S&T did not produce statistically or clinically
significant levels of change compared with a WL/TAU
control group. As a psychoeducational intervention,
S&T's limited impact on trauma symptomatology was
expected. However, as an intervention designed to
stabilize symptoms, there are concerns about how
effective this intervention might be in a prison setting.”
