Recovery (TIR) program
Study examines “the
effectiveness of traumatic
incident reduction (TIR). It
is a brief, memory-based,
therapeutic intervention
and was used to treat
symptoms of post-
traumatic stress disorder

anxiety, and low
expectancy of success (i.e.,
low self-efficacy)” (40).

“The study used a true
experimental design with a
pretest-posttest control
condition and a 3-month
follow-up. One hundred and
twenty-three people met the
criteria for inclusion in the
study and were randomly
assigned either to a treatment
or a control condition. In the
experimental condition, 56
individuals were pretested,
received TIR, and were post-
tested a week after treatment.
In the control condition, the
remaining 67 individuals were
pretested and post-tested but
did not receive TIR treatment
during the study period.” (44)","4 - Small sample RCT with
relatively low mortality. Study

counterproductive to the
process of TIR” (44),
indicating the treatment may
have efficacy for a specific
type of individual only. Study
used “four measures

multidimensional
measurement battery of
PTSD.” (45)","“The efficacy of TIR in alleviating PTSD, depression,
anxiety, and low expectancy of success received support
from this study: Statistically significant results were
observed on all measures at both posttest and follow-up
measurement periods except for the Intrusion subscale
of the PTSD Symptom Scale at the posttest interval.
However, differences were found at the follow-up
testing interval. It appears that the control group’s
scores remained stable across all three testing periods,
whereas the treatment condition’s scores decreased
steadily.” (49)
“The treatment condition inmates scored higher on the
pretest than did the control condition inmates. The
treatment condition inmates’ decrease continued over
time, and the control condition’s mild decrease
stabilized.” (50)"
