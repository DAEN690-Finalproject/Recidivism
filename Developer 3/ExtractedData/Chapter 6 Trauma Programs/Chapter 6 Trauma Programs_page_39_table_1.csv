This study investigates
“the effects of the
transcendental meditation
(TM) program on total
trauma symptoms,
anxiety, depression,
dissociation, sleep
disturbance, and
perceived stress in a
population of incarcerated
individuals with a
moderate- to high-risk
criminal profile.” (1)
It “is the first known
published study to
evaluate the effects of the
TM program on trauma
symptoms in prison
inmates.” (1)

Oregon, one medium

“The treatment group was
taught the TM technique in a
standard 7-step course (during
5 sessions lasting approximately
1 hour per session). They were
then encouraged to practice
this stress reduction technique
for 20 minutes twice a day,
once in the morning and once
in the late afternoon. Two
certified TM teachers who had
more than 10 years of teaching
experience were the instructors
for this study. Subjects in the
control group continued with
their daily schedule and did not
participate in the TM program.
All subjects in both groups
continued to receive their usual
care.” (2)","5 - Well-designed RCT. Of 181
participants initially randomly
assigned, 144 were ultimately
included in the analyses with
essentially equivalent n’s.","“Significant reductions in total trauma (F[1, 141] =
19.73, p < 0.001), as well as the dissociation (F[1, 141] =
18.21, p < 0.001), depression (F[1, 141] = 13.32, p <
0.001), anxiety (F[1, 141] = 14.23, p < 0.001), and sleep
disturbance subscales (F[1, 141] = 21.61, p < 0.001) on
the TSC, and perceived stress (F(1, 140) = 27.09, p <
0.001) were observed in the TM group compared with
controls. Effect sizes were mostly in the moderate to
large range, with depression and anxiety subscales =
0.50 and the Perceived Stress Scale= 0.75, relative to a
usual-care control group.” (4-5)
“Results for the high-trauma symptoms subgroup
indicated that the TM program might be particularly
efficacious for those with higher levels of trauma
symptoms.” (5)"
