(2013)",,"TARGET program
“A group psychotherapy
designed to enhance
affect regulation without
trauma memory
processing—Trauma
Affect Regulation: Guide
for Education and Therapy
(TARGET)—was compared
to a supportive group
therapy (SGT) in a
randomized clinical trial
with 72 incarcerated
women with full or partial
PTSD.” (262)
(York Correctional
Institution in Connecticut)",,,"Randomized Control Trial (RCT):
“Randomized Control Trial with
two groups (72 participants
total). To achieve a randomized
design, participants were
placed in cohorts of N= 10–12
as they enrolled in the study,
and cohorts were randomly
assigned to first receive one of
the two group therapies. After
completing the assigned group
therapy, participants in each
cohort were re-tested for the
posttreatment assessment, and
then provided the other group
therapy. Posttreatment data
collected following the first
type of group therapy that each
participant received are
reported in order to avoid a
confounding of the effects of
the two therapies. Participants
were informed during the
consent process that they
would receive two group
therapies believed to be helpful
for women coping with stress,
with a 50-50 chance of
receiving either type of group
therapy first.” (264)","5 - “Of 197 women screened,
80 were eligible and
randomized (by a study
assessor with numbers
concealed in sealed
envelopes prepared by
another study staff who used
an Excel random number
generator).” (265) 38
participants received the
TARGET therapy first, 32
participants went through
SGT therapy first. Results
were compared after the first
therapy was completed.","“Dropout rates were very low (5%) compared to those
reported in prior studies of group therapy with
incarcerated women (approximately 33%). However, full
remission from PTSD occurred for only 12% to 23% of
participants. The reduction, on average, in CAPS PTSD
severity was comparable to that reported by Zlotnick
and colleagues (2009), i.e., approximately 12 to 13
points, but only half the amount of improvement
reported in studies of TARGET as a one-to-one therapy
for women and girls.” (271)
“TARGET did not achieve greater improvement in affect
regulation than SGT. The small increase in Negative
Mood Regulation (NMR) scores achieved on average by
TARGET recipients suggest that the gains in affect
regulation from brief group therapy may not be
sufficient to reverse the trend of worsening affect
dysregulation that has been documented among
incarcerated women over time.” (271)
“TARGET participants’ increase in sense of forgiveness
(while SGT participants reported a decrease). This
finding suggests that a therapeutic focus on affect
regulation may provide a basis for incarcerated women
with PTSD to achieve a greater sense of emotional
resolution in relation to past victimization or betrayal.”
