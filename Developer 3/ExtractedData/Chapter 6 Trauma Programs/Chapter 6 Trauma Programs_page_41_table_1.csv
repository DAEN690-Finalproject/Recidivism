Assessment of Beyond
Violence (BV) — a 20-
session curriculum-based
intervention for women.
The program “has a core
goal of preventing
recidivism and further
violent behavior by
women who have already
engaged in violence; it also
aims to improve women’s
mental health and anger
expression and reduce
substance use.” (663)

“At the point of prison
treatment, a randomized
control trial was designed,
assigning women to receive one
of two treatments in 1:1 ratio.

criteria for the intervention
study included conviction of a
violent offense, substance
abuse dependency or positive
drug screen during
incarceration, no serious
mental health issue that
specifically involved housing on

eligibility for release on parole
within 18 to 24 months.” (664-

condition (TAU n =16; BV n =
19). Of the women involved
in this study, there were no
differences in measures of
mental health (i.e.,
depression, anxiety, PTSD) at
pretest. All of the women in
the BV condition completed
the treatment intervention
(defined as 75% or more of
the sessions), but 5 of the
women in the TAU condition
did not complete treatment.
However, women in the TAU
condition attended a
significantly greater number
of sessions, irrespective of
their completion status (TAU
33.75 vs. BV 18.47; t = 4.57, p
< .001).” (665-6)","The study “found no differences between the treatment
groups on demographic characteristics of age at offense
(M= 30.26, SD = 9.17), age at time of treatment (M =
33.66, SD = 8.91) or race (46% White, 54% African
American). Although all women had a current or
previous offense categorized as an assaultive felony,
there was a greater period of time between prison
treatment admission and release onto parole status for
women in the BV condition as compared to the TAU (562
days vs. 378 days; t = 2.88, p =.007).” (667)
“In terms of recidivism, no woman from either condition
returned to prison during the 12-month study period,
which suggests that none of the women in the sample
committed any serious offense or parole violation. When
using arrest as an outcome, 11% (n = 2) of BV women
and 38% (n = 6) of TAU women had evidence of a new
arrest (x2 = 3.58; p = .06).” (667)
“There were no significant differences between groups
on any of the variables associated with relapse. Of the
34 women, 13 had at least one positive drug screen
during the 12-month post incarceration period; 5 (26%)
were from the BV condition, and 8 (50%) were from the
TAU group (x2 = 2.09; p =.15).” (669)"
