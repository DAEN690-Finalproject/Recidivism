of 37,231 male individuals
who were released from
Israel prisons during a nine-
year period from 2004 to

outcome measures, post-
release employment (and
months of employment)
during the 1st year after

within 3 years). Sample sizes
for the five education
programs varied:
12th grade: 526 participants

grade: n=2580 vs. 677; 6th

experiment with propensity
score matching. However, the
cohort was released from prison
over a long period of time, which
introduces variable time at risk
as a confounding factor. In
addition, the researchers report
that individuals who did not
provide information on their
prior education level were
excluded from the study. No data
were provided on the size of this
group. Differences between the
size of the program cohorts and
their corresponding comparison
groups were noted.","Researchers found that “the four educational
correction programs we analyzed demonstrated
two patterns of effect – participants in the 12th
grade and 8th grade programs showed
significantly better outcomes than non-
participants in both recidivism and employment,
whereas participants in the 10th grade and 6th
grade programs only showed significantly better
employment outcomes.” (6)"
