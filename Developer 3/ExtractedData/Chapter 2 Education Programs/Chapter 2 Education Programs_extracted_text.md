## EDUCATION PROGRAMS

In this chapter, we review prison-based education programs. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) offers five First Step Act (FSA) approved programs in this category, all of which are classified by the BOP as Evidence-Based Recidivism Reduction (EBRR) Programs. We begin by describing the BOP's education programs, to include the assessment of needs addressed by the programs. We then describe our study identification procedures, provide a review of evaluations conducted both inside and outside  of the BOP, compare  BOP programs to evaluated programs in other jurisdictions, and offer an assessment of the effectiveness of each BOP education program based on  our  review.  We  then  conclude  this  chapter  with  recommendations  for  future  education programming initiatives.

## 2.1 Overview of Education Needs and Programs

The Education Services Branch (ESB) in  the Reentry Services Division (RSD) is responsible for supporting the delivery of education programs. Education departments in the BOP offer both educational and vocational training programs.  Per policy, all education department programs must include a written curriculum with measurable behavioral objectives and periodic reviews to ensure  relevance  and  effectiveness,  assessment  of  students'  progress,  and  clear  criteria  for program completion (ESB, 2002).

In the institutions, most education programs are staffed by teachers. In the BOP, teachers must possess either a bachelor's degree including supervised student teaching, a bachelor's degree with  a  full  academic  year  of  professional  teaching  experience,  or  a  teacher  certification  or licensure. Teachers are required to devote at least 50% of their 40-hour week to direct instruction (ESB, 2002). Policy also calls for most institutions to include a special education teacher in their staffing complement to serve special learning needs individuals. In the BOP, special education teachers must have at least 24 semester hours of special education coursework and either one year of relevant teaching experience or a master's degree in education.

All  teachers  are  also  required  to  complete  48  hours  of  BOP-sponsored  continuing  education training  every  3  years.  This  training  includes  a  mix  of  professional  development  activities consistent with their work assignments and reviews of relevant BOP policies and procedures. In addition, the Supervisor of Education is required to observe each teacher in the classroom at least annually to review their performance (ESB, 2002).

Education programs may also be supported with volunteers and contractors.

## 2.1.1 Identifying Education Needs

Within  90  days  of  their  initial  designation  to  a  BOP  institution,  incarcerated  individuals  are assessed  via  the  Test  of  Adult  Basic  Education  (TABE)  or  the  Comprehensive  Adult  Student Assessments System (CASAS) (BOP, 2022). The TABE assesses three core subject areas: reading, mathematics,  and  language,  using  mature,  life-  and  work-related  situations.  There  are  five overlapping levels in the TABE: literacy, easy, medium, difficult, and advanced, and each core subject  area  includes  content  relevant  to  grade  levels  K-12  (TABE,  n.d.).  This  assessment  is conducted to identify the individual 's educational needs and educational level.

As an alternative to the TABE, the CASAS is administered to non-English speaking incarcerated individuals. Per Program Statement 5350.24 English-as-a-Second Language Program , individuals are referred for further evaluation via the CASAS if they meet one of three criteria: an inability to complete the education interview form in English, an inability to comprehend Admission and Orientation lectures conducted in English, and/or an inability to read and understand information at their Initial Classification (ESB, 1997). The CASAS is administered to further screen for program admission, to evaluate progress in the program, and to ensure competency at the 8 th grade level. In addition to assessing reading comprehension, mathematics, and writing skills, the CASAS also evaluates listening and speaking skills for English language learners (CASAS, n.d.).  Results of the CASAS are reported on a numerical scale, and the scale is divided into five levels, A-E. To bypass enrollment in the English-as-a-Second-Language Program, individuals must perform at Level C (Advanced  English  Language  Learner)  or  above  (ESB,  1997).  A  summary  of  TABE  and  CASAS assessment data is not publicly available; however, such a summary would offer a more precise understanding of the educational needs of federally incarcerated individuals. According to the BOP's most recent needs assessment report, 35% of the in carcerated population presents with an education need. Also of note, for approximately 11% of the incarcerated population, English is not their first language.

## 2.1.2 Identifying Dyslexia Needs

In addition to a general assessment of educational needs, the First Step Act (FSA) requires the BOP to implement a dyslexia screening program and to offer relevant programs for incarcerated individuals identified through this screening program. Consistent with this requirement, targeted assessment procedures are in place to identify individuals with this specific educational need. Program  Statement  5200.06  Management  of  Inmates  with  Disabilities outlines  a  two-step process to identify individuals with dyslexia, in addition to the assessment methods noted above (WSPB, 2019).

In the first step, education staff complete the Screening Checklist for Dyslexia (SCD), reviewing historical information related to learning disorders, processing skills, and perceptional problems. When a threshold score is met on the SCD, or if additional information suggesting dyslexia is present, the second step is initiated, with a qualified, trained staff member administering the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement and Oral Language, two components of the broadscope Woodcock-Johnson IV assessment system. The Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement evaluations  four  broad  academic  domains:  reading,  written  language,  mathematics,  and academic knowledge (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2014). The Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Oral Language is a diagnostic supplement to the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement, allowing for a more complete evaluation of specific learning disabilities. This assessment addresses oral language, broad oral language, oral expression, listening comprehension, phonetic coding, speed of lexical access, and vocabulary (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2014).

The results are then forwarded to the Supervisor of Education to determine if 'the propensity for dyslexia exists' (WSPB, 2019). Per the BOP's most recent needs assessment report, less than 1% of the population presents with dyslexia as a need (BOP, 2022). Specific findings related to the two-step need identification process are not publicly available; however, additional information could lend support to the low level of need noted in this area. For example, a summary of SCD results,  notation  of  the  number  of  individuals  referred  for  further  evaluation,  a  summary  of Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement and Oral Language results, and notation of the number of individuals referred to the Supervisor of Education for review would be informative.

## 2.2 Education Program Descriptions

Five  FSA-approved  programs  are  primarily  educational  in  nature  -  the  Barton  Reading  and Spelling System, Hooked on Phonics, Bureau Literacy, Post-Secondary Education, and English-asa-Second  Language  Programs.  Each  education  program  is  aimed  at  advancing  an  individual 's educational attainment to a  higher grade or functional level. These programs serve different target populations with unique educational needs.

The below table outlines key features of the BOP's five education programs, including the target population, needs addressed, and program dosage. In addition, the table notes the number of institutions offering the program and the number of individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2023.    Lastly,  the  table  provides  an  estimate  of  the  percentage  of  the  target population served by the program to date. Specifically, this estimate compares the total number of program participants and graduates in custody to the total number of individuals in custody with a potential need for such a program. This estimate represents an educated guess, as we did not have access to data allowing for perfect one-to-one comparisons of needs and programs. Following the table, each education program is described in detail.

## 2.2.1 The Barton Reading and Spelling System Program

The Barton Reading and Spelling System Program is classified by the BOP as an EBRR Program (BOP, 2022). The stated goal of the program is to improve the reading, spelling, and writing skills of individuals with dyslexia, the target population for this program. Per Education Services staff, the  program  was  implemented  in  the  BOP  in  March  2022,  replacing  the  Hooked  on  Phonics Program (see below) as the BOP's primary approach to addressing the dyslexia need.  Education Services staff also noted as of October 2022, all institutions were required to have completed staff training for the program and implemented the program if any individuals with an identified dyslexia need were at the institution.

The Barton Reading and Spelling System Program was developed in 1999 by Susan Barton, an educator  with  a  special  interest  in  dyslexia  and  founder  of  Bright  Solutions  for  Dyslexia,  the publisher  of  the  program.  The  program  is  'an  Orton -Gillingham  influenced,  scientific-based, evidence-driven,  multi-sensory,  direct,  explicit,  structured,  sequential,  one-to-one  tutoring

system'  to  address  dyslexia  in  adults  (BOP,  2022).  The  program  relies  primarily  on  an individualized,  1:1  instruction  method;  however,  the  program  can  also  be  delivered  in  small groups of up to three students. The Barton Reading and Spelling System website describes the program  as  follows:  'instructional  delivery  is  explicit  and  systematic  with  scaffolding  and coordinated  instructional  routines  for  phonemic  awareness,  phonics,  and  advanced  word analysis' and in this context 'each sound/symbol correspondence is explicitly taught, practiced and then reviewed during the next several lessons while additional sound/symbol correspondences are introduced' (Barton Reading and Spelling System, 2021).

The program includes ten levels, and each level is accompanied by a tutor manual, reproduceable student  pages,  color  coded  letter  tiles,  reinforcement  games,  pre-  and  post-tests,  and  tutor training  DVDs.    The  ten  levels  address  the  following  topics:  (1)  phonemic  awareness,  (2) consonants and short vowels, (3) closed and unit syllables, (4) syllable division and vowel teams, (5) prefixes and suffixes, (6) six reasons for silent-E, (7) vowel-R syllables, (8) advanced vowel teams, (9) influences of foreign languages, and (10) Greek words and Latin roots (Barton Reading and Spelling System, 2021). Most students begin with Level 1, and a post-test accompanying Level 1  identifies  the  next  appropriate  instructional  level.  Levels  3-10  require  approximately  3-5 months of instruction per level and levels 1-2 require less time, with the total program completed in an estimated 23 years. Of note, in refining the target population for this program, the BOP's internal website notes individuals who can pass the initial screening within the Barton Reading and  Spelling  System  are  most  appropriate  for  the  program.  If  an  individual  cannot  pass  the screening, the Hooked on Phonics Program is noted to be a more suitable program to address their early learning English language challenges (BOP, n.d.).

Per the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Barton Reading and Spelling System Program requires approximately 500 hours to complete (BOP, 2022). Per the program developer, when offered as a 1:1 intervention, the program requires two instructional hours/ week. The BOP's internal website directs teachers to provide 45-60 minute tutoring sessions 2-3 times per week (BOP, n.d.). When offered in a small group setting, five instructional hours/week are required to ensure individual success (Barton Reading and S pelling System, 2021). The BOP's internal website directs teachers to provide 90-120 minute sessions when two individuals are tutored and 135180 minute sessions when three individuals are tutored (BOP, n.d.). Formal training is required to facilitate the program and training materials are included with the program, i.e., tutor training DVDs for each level, as well as the guidance in each tutor manual. Approximately five hours of tutor  training  is  provided  for  each  level  of  the  program.  A  program  fidelity  checklist  is  also available on the Barton Reading and Spelling System website.

The Barton Reading and Spelling System Program is not explicitly referenced in BOP policies. Therefore,  there  is  no  policy  mandate  for  institutions  to  offer  this  program  and  address  an

identified dyslexia need; however, ESB staff noted guidance has been provided to the institutions to do so. Successful completion of the program is based on mastery of the material in each level, i.e., a score of 95% better on each level's post test. The BOP's internal website notes successful -completion  of  the  course  ensures  individual s  'understand  the  basic  skills  involved  in  word decoding  and  phonetic  awareness  as  well  as  develop  additional  basic  reading,  writing,  and spelling  skills,  which  leads  to  grea ter  comprehension  of  the  English  language'  (BOP,  n.d.). Anticipated outcomes for the program are a reduction in the symptoms of dyslexia, as well as the acquisition of reading and spelling skills and a reduction in the risk of recidivism.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Barton Reading and Spelling System Program is described  as  available  at  all  institutions;  however,  at  the  close  of  FY  2023  the  program  was offered at 85 institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, no individuals participated in or completed the program; it appears this program was implemented in calendar year 2022 (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 198 individuals participating in the program, up from 55 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP 2022; BOP, 2023). At present, 27.04% of the BOP population with a dyslexia need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023). (To date, one individual  in  BOP  custody  has  completed  the  program.)  In  response  to  a  June  2023  inquiry, Education Services staff reported 282 individuals were on a waiting list for the program. As noted above, this program is resource intensive, with a teacher-to-student ratio of 1:1 or 1:3, which may account for the relatively low participation numbers.

## 2.2.2 Hooked on Phonics Program

The Hooked on Phonics Program is classified by the BOP as an EBRR Program (BOP, 2022). The stated  goal  of  the  program  is  to  support  the  development  of  basic  reading  skills,  the  target population  for  this  program  being  incarcerated  individuals  who  lack  the  basic  reading  skills required to participate fully in the Bureau Literacy Program. The Hooked on Phonics Program is provided to individuals who score below the second grade reading level on the TABE or CASAS. Of note, individuals with dyslexia are not referred to this program; they are referred to the Barton Reading and Spelling System Program. The specific need addressed in the program is education. Per the BOP's most recent need assessment report, 32%  of the population  presents with an educational need; however, the percentage of individuals requiring intervention at this level is likely much smaller (BOP, 2022). In refining the target population for this program, the BOP's internal website notes the program is most beneficial for individuals who have an IQ of 70 or lower, limited English speaking skills or comprehension at a minimum second grade level, an expressive or receptive language disorder, and/or are unable to pass the Barton Reading and Spelling System's student screening despite repeated attempts and assistance from the program

tutor (BOP, n.d.). As noted above, additional summary information related to TABE and CASAS results would provide a more granular view of educational needs in this area.

Originally developed in the 1980s, the Hooked on Phonics Program is a 'proven, expert -designed early  language  readiness  reading  program'  using  'systematic  phonics  instruction  through scaffolding of simple sentences and paragraphs to teach letter-sound correlations for reading purposes' (BOP, 2022). In simple terms, the program is a multisensory intervention to assist early readers with recognizing the relationship between letters and sounds. Curriculum materials are available  on  the  Hooked  on  Phonics  website  and these  materials  include  instructional  DVDs. Originally designed for grades K-2, the curriculum is also applicable for adults whose command of the English language is below the second grade level. There is not an adult-specific curriculum. The program consists of eight levels, with multiple lessons per level. Lessons cover concepts for early  emergent  readers  (pre-K)  through  early  fluent  readers  (second  grade).  The  program 'introduces simple and compound words as well as two syllable words to support corresponding decoding skills, reading, word recognition, and spel ling' (BOP, n.d.).  Per the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Hooked on Phonics Program requires approximately 500 hours to complete (BOP, 2022).

The  Hooked  on  Phonics  Program  is  not  explicitly  referenced  in  BOP  policies.  Consequently, institutions  are  afforded  latitude,  in  that  they  may  choose  not  to  implement  this  specific program.  The  standard  for  successful  completion  of  the  program  is  linked  to  the  ability  to 'understand the basic skills involved in word decoding and phonetic awareness as well as develop additional basic reading and comprehension skills' (BOP, n.d.). To reach this objective, there are criteria in place for completing each level in the Hooked on Phonics Program, i.e., level-based examinations. Anticipated outcomes for the program are an acquisition of basic reading skills and a reduction in the risk of recidivism.

In  the  BOP's  FSA  Approved Programs Guide, the Hooked on Phonics Program is described as available  at  all  institutions;  however,  at  the  close  of  FY  2023  the  program  was  offered  at  54 institutions (BOP, 2023). In calendar year 2021, 155 individuals were enrolled in the program and 37  individuals  completed  the  program  (BJS,  2022).  At  the  close  of  FY  2023,  there  were  98 individuals participating in the program, down from 218 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2022; BOP, 2023). This decrease is likely associated with the BOP's shift to use of the Barton Reading and Spelling System Program for individuals with dyslexia. At present,  .49%  of  the  BOP  population  with  an  education  need  either  (1)  are  enrolled  in  the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program, nor is it clear how many individuals accurately require this level of programming.

## 2.2.3 Bureau Literacy Program

The Bureau Literacy Program is classified by the BOP as an EBRR Program (BOP, 2022). The stated goals of the program are to foster the acquisition of foundational knowledge and skills in reading, math,  and  written  expression  and  to  prepare  students  to  obtain  a  Graduate  Education Development (GED) credential (ESB, 2003). Consequently, the target population for this program is incarcerated  individuals  without  a  high  school  diploma,  GED  certificate,  High  School Equivalency Test (HiSET) certificate, or Test Assessing Secondary Completion (TASC) certificate. Individuals are placed in the program if a verified high school diploma or GED, HiSET, or TASC certificate is not included in their available records.  Program participation is required for these individuals. To fulfill this requirement, individuals must complete a minimum of 240 instructional hours in the program or attain a GED certificate. Failure to do so may impact an  individual 's institutional job assignment and the vesting of good conduct time.  Some individuals are exempt from  this  requirement,  e.g.,  deportable  immigrants,  individuals  in  pre-trial  status,  individuals with significant emotional, mental, or physical impediments. The specific need addressed in the program is education (BOP, 2022). Per the BOP's most recent Fact Sheet, 35% of the population currently presents with this specific education need (BOP, 2022). Of note, an additional 10% of the  current  population  obtained  a  GED  credential  while  in  BOP  custody,  i.e.,  via  the  Bureau Literacy Program.

The Bureau Literacy Program consists of an adult basic education to accommodate all academic levels (BOP, 2022). The program's GED -based curriculum, Reading Through Language Arts and Mathematical Reasoning, was designed to align with College and Career Readiness Standards for Adult Education and the GED Testing Service High Impact Indicators (BOP, n.d.). The curriculum was developed by the BOP's Education Branch in partnership with a select group of teachers in the institutions. The core curriculum is maintained on the BOP's internal website, Sallyport. The curriculum outlines specific skills and concepts and provides strategies, resources, and activities for teachers to incorporate into their instruction. Specifically, the curriculum identifies a series of educational  standards,  cites  objectives  associated  with  each  standard,  and  notes  what  the learner  should  know,  understand,  and  be  able  to  do  once  they  achieve  each  objective.  The curriculum  includes  a  series  of  suggested  class  activities  and  resources,  with  hyperlinks  to download the referenced materials. The curriculum also references to pages from Steck-Vaughn GED  preparation  materials,  a  population  preparation  resource  from  educational  publisher Houghton  Miffilin  available  in  all  institutions.  Per  policy,  the  Bureau  Literacy  Program  is conducted Monday-Friday, for a minimum of 90-minutes per day (Education Branch, 2003). Per the FSA Approved Programs Guide, the program requires approximately 240 hours to complete (BOP, 2022).

The  Bureau  Literacy  Program  is  referenced  primarily  in Program Statement 5350.28 Literacy Program (GED Standard) (ESB,  2003).  This  policy  details  the  purpose,  target  population,  and admission and enrollment procedures of the program in considerable detail (Education Branch, 2003). Relevant Program Review Guidelines, which serve as fidelity measures for the Bureau Literacy  Program,  are  drawn  from  this  policy,  as  well  as  from Program  Statement  5300.21 Education, Training, and Leisure Time Program Standards . Successful completion of the program is based on attainment of a GED certificate. As noted above, required participation in the program may be waived after 240 instructional hours; however, an individual is not considered to have successfully completed the program without obtaining a GED certificate. Anticipated outcomes for  the  program  are  an  acquisition  of  reading,  math,  and  written  expression  skills,  a  GED certificate, and a reduction in the risk of recidivism.

In  the  BOP's  FSA  Approved  Programs  Guide,  the  program  is  described  as  available  at  all institutions. This availability is supported by policy requirements outlined in Program Statement 5350.28 Literacy Program (GED Standard) and applicable federal regulations contained in this policy (ESB, 2003). In calendar year 2021, 11,402 individuals were enrolled in the program and 2,005 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 11,504 individuals  participating  in  the  program,  down  from  13,187  individuals  participating  in  the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2022; BOP 2023). At present, 40.35% of the BOP population with an education need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023).  It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this  program;  however, the most recent BOP Fact Sheet also indicates approximately 26% of individuals in need of a GED certificate are currently enrolled in the Bureau Literacy Program (BOP, 2023).

## 2.2.4 Post-Secondary Education Program

The Post-Secondary Education Program is classified by the BOP as an EBRR Program (BOP, 2022). The stated goal of the program is to enhance marketable skills via the acquisition of a college degree or certificate. The target population for this program is incarcerated individuals with a high school diploma or GED certificate and a work need. Work needs are assessed via a review of the individual's employment background, which is described further in the below description of vocational programs.

The Post-Secondary Education Program seeks to bring a college learning environment into the institutions,  via  classes  provided  by  credentialed  instructors  from  the  local  community.  The program consists of college level courses leading to an occupationally oriented college degree (i.e.,  associate  or  bachelor's  degree) or  an  adult  occupational  education  certificate.  Of  note, based on feedback from Education Services staff, it appears there is some overlap between this

program and the Certification Course Training Program, which may also include coursework at the  college  level.  Degree  programs  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  hospitality  management, business  administration  and  management,  accounting,  bookkeeping,  office  management, advanced microcomputer operations, and horticulture. Consistent with community standards for post-secondary education, the program is delivered via lectures, group discussions, readings, examinations,  and  written  assignments.  The  program  is  provided  by  a  college  or  university, through a contract with the local institution. Programming hours vary based on the affiliated college  or  university's  teaching  schedule  and  the  college  degree/certificate  sought  by  the individual, with 500 hours of programming credit noted as the maximum earnable amount in the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide (BOP, 2022).

The program is described in BOP policy, in Program Statement 5354.03 Postsecondary Education Programs for Inmates (ESB, 2003). This policy addresses the administration, focus, funding, and general  standards  of  the  program.  In  addition,  per Program  Statement  5300.21  Education, Training  and  Leisure  Time  Program  Standards , the  program is staffed  by  appropriately credentialed contractors from accredited colleges and universities (ESB, 2002). These contractors have  the  education  and  experience  required  to  teach  at  the  post-secondary  level.  Relevant Program Review Guidelines which serve as fidelity measures for the Post-Secondary Education Program are drawn from these policies. Successful completion of the program is based on the receipt of passing grades in individual courses leading to the awarding of a college/university degree or certificate. Anticipated outcomes for the program are an acquisition of marketable skills and a reduction in the risk of recidivism.

In the BOP's FSA Approved Programs Guide, the Post -Secondary Education Program is listed as available at 16 institutions: FCI Bennettsville, SC; FCI Beaumont Low, TX; FCI Beaumont Medium, TX MDC Brooklyn, NY; FPC Bryan, TX; FCI Cumberland, MD; FCI Dublin, CA; FCI Englewood, CO; FCI Gilmer, WV; FCC Lompoc, CA; FCI Milan, MI; FCI Ray Brook, NY; FCI Williamsburg, VA; FCI Waseca, MN; FPC Yankton, SD; and FCI Yazoo City, MS; however, at the close of FY 2023 the program did not appear to be offered at FCI Cumberland, MD or FPC Yankton, SD (BOP, 2022). The program did appear to be offered at 10 additional sites - USP Atlanta, GA; USP Atwater, CA; USP Big  Sandy,  WV;  FCI  Danbury,  CT;  FCI  Fort  Dix,  NJ;  FCI  Herlong,  CA;  FCI  McKean,  PA;  FCI Talladega, AL; and FCI Victorville I and II, CA - for a total of 24 institutions offering the program. In calendar year 2021, 338 individuals were enrolled in the program and 32 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, there were 1,040 individuals participating in the program, up from 587 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2022; BOP, 2023). At present, 1.25% of the BOP population with a work need either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023). It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 2.2.5 English-as-a-Second Language Program

The English-as-a-Second Language Program is classified by the BOP as an EBRR Program. The program is an English language literacy course for non-native speakers (BOP, 2022).  The stated goal of the program is to facilitate the acquisition of English language fluency at the 8 th grade level or above. Consequently, the target population for this program is incarcerated individuals with limited English language fluency. As noted above, the CASAS is administered to screen for program admission, to evaluate progress in the program, and to ensure competency at the 8 th grade level. The program is required for individuals lacking English language fluency at the 8 th grade  level.  To  fulfill  the  program  participation  requirement,  individuals  must  complete  a minimum of 240 instructional hours in the program or demonstrate English language fluency at the 8 th grade level on the CASAS. Failure to do so may impact an individual 's  institutional job assignment  and  the  vesting  of  good  conduct  time.  Some  individuals  are  exempt  from  this requirement,  e.g.,  deportable  immigrants,  individuals  in  pre-trial  status,  individuals  with significant  emotional,  mental,  or  physical  impediments.  The  specific  needs  addressed  in  the program are education and work (BOP, 2022). As noted above, a summary of CASAS results would provide  additional  information  about  the  percentage  of  individuals  requiring  this  specific educational intervention. A 2021 Bureau of Justice Statistics report noted for 13% of federally incarcerated individuals, English is their second language; however, the report does not indicate how many of these individuals are fluent in English (BJS, 2021).

In the English-as-a-Second Language Program, 'students receive individual attention from their teachers as part of differentiated learning classroom models driven by individual learning needs' (BOP, 2022). Cultural and social contexts in the community are considered in instruction, with instruction b ased on students' English ability, interests, and needs. Specifically, the curriculum addresses the following English language skills:  grammar, reading, comprehension, writing, and vocabulary.  Curriculum  resour ces  are  maintained  on  the  BOP's  internal  website,  Sallyport. Standardized English-as-a-Second Language lesson plans and worksheets across five educational levels are included on the website (BOP, n.d.). A level addresses specific themes, and includes listening/speaking, reading/writing, and functions/workplace skills, along with course activities to  practice  these  skills.  In  addition,  the  BOP's  internal  website  includes  continuing  education opportunities for teachers of English-as-a-Second language through ESL-Pro, English Language Learner University, and the LINCS Resource collection (BOP, n.d.). These resources include English Language  Proficiency  Standards  for  Adult  Education.  In  the  BOP,  the  English-as-a-Second Language Program is conducted Monday through Friday, for a minimum of two hours/day (ESB, 1997).  In  the  FSA  Approved  Programs  Guide,  the  BOP  estimates  the  program  requires approximately  500  hours  to  complete  (BOP,  2022).  The  program  has  a  dedicated  instructor, either a BOP teacher, or a contractor or volunteer with the necessary instructional skills.

The  English-as-a-Second  Language  Program  is  referenced  primarily  in Program  Statement 5350.24 English-as-a-Second Language Program (ESB ,  1997). This policy details the program's purpose,  target  population,  and  admission  and  enrollment  in  considerable  detail.  Relevant Program  Review  Guidelines  which  serve  as  fidelity  measures  for  the  English-as-a-Second Language  Program  are  drawn  from  this  policy,  as  well  as  from Program  Statement  5300.21 Education, Training, and Leisure Time Program Standards . Successful completion of the program is based on attaining minimum CASAS scores. Specifically, individuals must obtain a minimum score of 225 on the CASAS Level C Reading Certificate Test and a minimum score of 215 on the CASAS Level B or C Listing Comprehension test to successfully complete the program. As noted above,  required  participation  in  the  program  may  be  waived  after  240  instructional  hours; however, an individual is not considered to have successfully completed the program without the requisite CASAS scores. The anticipated outcome for the program is the acquisition of English language skills at or beyond the 8 th grade level.

In  the  BOP's  FSA  Approved  Programs  Guide,  the  program  is  described  as  available  at  all institutions. This availability is supported by policy requirements outlined in Program Statement 5350.24 English-as-a-Second Language Program and applicable federal regulations contained in this policy (Education Branch, 1997). However, at the close FY 2023, 15 institutions did not appear to be offering the program. In calendar year 2021, 1,521 individuals were enrolled in the program and 542 individuals completed the program (BJS, 2022). At the close of FY 2023, 1,816 individuals were participating in the program, up slightly from 1,726 individuals participating in the program at the close of FY 2022 (BOP, 2022; BOP, 2023). At present, 19.86% of the BOP population with English as a second language either (1) are enrolled in the program or (2) have completed the program since implementation of the FSA (BOP, 2023). It is not clear whether there is a waiting list for this program.

## 2.3 Study Identification Procedures

To  create  our  study  database,  we  first  examined  all  published  meta-analyses  and  systematic reviews of prison-based education programs published during our review period (2000-present). These reviews typically also included several other program types under the broad grouping of prison work, education, and vocational programs. Eight meta-analyses and systematic reviews were  identified  (see  Appendix  Table  2A  for  an  overview).  As  noted  in  Chapter  1,  a  strong argument can be made that evaluations of prison education programs operating in the 1990's and earlier are not relevant today, because of changes over time in program design components and incarcerated populations. Our review of these meta-analyses and systematic reviews did reveal several studies conducted since 2000; we included these studies in our review.

The next step in our study identification process was to determine whether these meta-analyses and  systematic  reviews  perhaps  missed  relevant  evaluations  due  to  the  search  procedures employed; or excluded them from their review due to their study inclusion criteria. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic search of the following electronic databases for the period from 2000-2022:

- · PsycINFO
- · National Criminal Justice Reference Service Abstracts
- · Education Abstracts [returns the same as British Education Index]
- · Criminal Justice Abstracts
- · Education Research Complete

We used the following specific terms for our systematic search of electronic databases:

## (inmates OR prisoners OR offenders Or incarceration) AND educat* AND recidivism

This search initially yielded 1,172 hits, with an initial list of 782 studies once duplicate articles across the databases were removed. Visual inspection of the titles and abstracts by the research team further reduced the number of potential studies, with 80 titles identified by the research team as requiring in-depth review. Specifically, we focused on studies that included one of the outcomes measures described in Chapter 1 (i.e., recidivism reduction, misconduct reduction, improved  institutional  adjustment,  skills acquisition) and  identified a control group  for comparison. 1

The majority of the 80 studies we examined in-depth did not meet our review criteria and were excluded. Based on our review of the studies included in the eight meta-analyses and systematic reviews  highlighted  in  Appendix  Table  2A,  along  with  the  results  of  our  search  of  electronic databases, we identified 23 evaluations of prison-based education programs for the period 2000 to 2022 that meet our review criteria (see Appendix Table 2B for an overview of each study). These evaluations can be further broken down into two groups: general evaluations of all types

of prison education programs; and specific evaluations of one program type. 2 We highlight this distinction in the following review.

## 2.4 Evaluations of Education Programs in the BOP

In the following section, we review the body of recent research (2000-2022) assessing a full range of prison education initiatives. We begin by documenting the lack of available BOP education program  evaluations,  while  identifying  new,  ongoing,  and  proposed  evaluations  of  BOP education  programs.  We  then  examine  a  full  range  of  evaluations  of  education  programs operating in state prisons around the USA, as well as a small number of relevant international studies of similar programs in other countries. For those programs operating outside of BOP that we have designated as effective, we have attempted to provide a preliminary assessment of the comparability  of  these  programs  to  current  BOP  programs.  We  conclude  our  examination  of prison education programs by offering recommendations regarding the need for ongoing fidelity assessment and outcome evaluation.

In a perfect world, our assessment of the effectiveness of the current portfolio of BOP's prison education programs would be based on evaluations of these programs. Unfortunately, this is not the case here. To the best of our knowledge, none of BOP's educa tion  programs 3 have  been formally  evaluated  during  the  period  under  review  (2000-present).  However,  according  to  a report provided by the BOP's Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) , the BOP does have plans to  evaluate  four  of  its  education  programs  in  the  near  future:  the  Bureau  Literacy  and  PostSecondary  Education  Programs  in  FY  2025  and  the  Barton  Reading  and  Spelling  System  and Hooked on Phonics Programs in FY 2026. There is no plan in place to evaluate the English-as-aSecond Language Program. In the absence of current evaluation research on education programs operated by the BOP, we have conducted a systematic review of the evaluation research on the effectiveness of education programs operating outside of BOP. Assuming these programs are similar in design and implementation to the BOP education programs, it is possible to assess the likely impact of BOP's programs ba sed on this body of research. To be clear, the effects of BOP education programs are currently unknown, because the necessary evaluation research has not been completed. However, FSA legislation did specify that programs that are likely to  reduce recidivism or have other positive outcomes can be identified as evidence-based programming.

## 2.5 Evaluations of Education Programs Outside BOP

A challenge in presenting a summary of research findings that can be used to classify specific programs  as  evidence-based  is  that  the  research  evidence  may  conflate  the  presentation  of findings from participation in -and/or completion of -several education programs into a single group of any educational program participants . Several of the educational program evaluations 4 included here only present overall -or general -program findings. While researchers may have had valid reasons for combining these participants into a single study group, these studies do not provide the definitive evidence of a specific program's impact on the outcomes of interest here: evidence of improvement in designated educational need areas, improved in-prison behavior, and positive post-release outcomes (e.g., more employment, lower recidivism).

We begin  our  review  by  looking  closely  at  the  results  of  GED,  high  school,  and  Adult  Basic Education  (ABE)  program  evaluations  (see Appendix  Table  2B ). Our  review  includes  16 evaluations covering at least one of these prison education programs. There are 14 GED program evaluations, 5 ABE evaluations, and 2 high school program evaluations. These 16 evaluations are comprised of one level 4 evaluation, 6 level 3 evaluations, 5 level 2 evaluations, and 4 level 1 evaluations.  Examination  of  the  level  3  and  above  studies  offers  strong  support  for  the classification of prison GED programs as evidence-based. The findings for both ABE programs and high school programs were not as clear-cut, and we cannot classify either program as evidence based. Two level 3 or above evaluations reported findings for ABE program participants (Cho &amp; Tyler, 2010; Fizer, 2020). One of these studies included participants in ABE and other education programs; they reported negative overall findings for post-release wages and recidivism (Cho &amp; Tyler, 2010). The other ABE study was a small, randomized control trial examining the impact of using trained peer tutors in ABE classrooms on student outcomes, using a pre-post skill testing exam. There were also two evaluations that looked at the provision of high school education in prison (Batiuk, 2005; Duwe and Clark, 2014). Batiuk (2005) found no effect for obtaining a high school education while in prison on post-release recidivism, while Duwe and Clark (2014) only presented results for comparison between a group of participants who earned a high school diploma or a GED while in prison and a matched comparison group that came into prison without these  credentials  and  did  not  earn  one  before  exiting.  Researchers  reported  no  impact  on

recidivism, but a positive impact on employment: 'post -release employment data show that 60% of offenders who earned secondary degrees in prison found employment within the first 2 years compared with 50% in the comparison group' (p. 468).

Next,  we  examined  the  results  of  literacy  program  evaluations.  Six  evaluations  fall  into  the literacy program category: Cho and Tyler (2010), Walk et al. (2021), Courtney (2009), Steurer, Smith and Tracy (2001), Fabelo (2002), and Hull et al. (2000). Details on the location, design quality, sample, and key findings for each of these evaluations are provided in Appendix Table 2B . Two of the six studies are classified as level 3 quasi-experimental studies; the remaining four studies did not apply adequate statistical controls for differences between treatment and control groups and were classified as level 2 or level 1 studies. One of the two level 3 evaluations, Cho and  Tyler's  (2010)  evaluation,  presented  general  results  for  a  number  of  different  education programs operated by the Florida Department of Corrections, including adult basic education and  other  educational  services,  such  as  literacy  classes  and  cognitive  life  skills  classes.  No program-specific details were provided. Researchers found no evidence that education program participation or completion was related to either positive employment or recidivism outcomes post-rel ease. The other level 3 study was Walk et al.'s (2021) evaluation of literacy programs operating in Israel's prisons. Researchers found that participants in literacy programs targeting incarcerated individuals at 6 th ,  8 th ,  10 th ,  and  12 th grade  reading  levels  had  significantly  better employment outcomes than individuals that did not participate in these programs. Participants in the 8 th and 12 th grade-level programs also had lower recidivism rates than non-participants. These findings from Israel are encouraging, but they may not be comparable to literacy programs currently operating in BOP facilities.

Both level 2 studies reported overall findings across programs. Courtney's (2009) evaluation of Arizona's  prison  education  programs  linked  combined  educational  program  participation  to reduced  levels  of  prison  misconduct,  while  Steurer  et  al.'s  (2001)  mult istate evaluation (Maryland,  Minnesota,  and  Ohio)  found  that  educational  program  participants  had  lower recidivism rates and better employment outcomes 3 years post-release than non-participants. The Courtney (2009) evaluation did report that GED program participants had lower misconduct rates than participants in either functional literacy or work-based education. Finally, the two level 1  studies  (Fabelo,  2001;  Hull  et  al.,  2000)  also  reported  positive  general recidivism  reduction findings  for  participants  in  academic  programs.  Overall,  the  results  of  our  literacy  program evaluation review are positive. While literacy programs do not yet meet our classification criteria for an effective, evidence-based program, it can be classified as a promising strategy, with one program-specific  level  3  study  reporting  positive  results,  and  several  lower-level  studies  also reporting positive findings. As we noted earlier, the second level 3 study (Cho &amp; Tyler, 2010) did

not present results for literacy classes, lumping them into a broad adult basic education group, which does not allow a direct assessment of the literacy program.

We also reviewed eight evaluations of prison post-secondary education programs, including 5 level 3 evaluations and 3 level 2 evaluations (see Appendix Table 2B). All five level 3 evaluations found  positive  effects  of  post-secondary  education  on  post-release  recidivism  outcomes. However, the results for employment outcomes were not positive in the only level 3 study that measured  post-release  employment  outcomes  (Duwe  &amp;  Clark,  2014).  Additional  research  is needed on why improvements in post-education while in prison do not appear to be linked to improvement  in  employment  prospects.  This  unanswered  question  notwithstanding,  the evidence  we  reviewed  that  measured  the  recidivism  reduction  effects  of  post-secondary education programs supports the designation of this education program as an effective evidencebased program.

Finally,  we  identified  one  prison-based  reading  instruction  program  evaluation  that  appears similar  to  BOP's  Hooked  on  Phonics  and  Barton  Reading  and  Spelling  System  Programs  (see Appendix Table 2B ).  Robinson  (2018)  conducted a small (n=41) randomized control trial at a prison in an unnamed midwestern state and found that incarcerated individuals who received instruction in the Pure and Complete Phonics (PCP) program had improved reading scores (using three measures of reading) that were higher than the scores for a control group of incarcerated individuals who received the standard reading curriculum. While these results do provide support for  the  BOP's  Hooked on Phonics and Barton Reading and Spelling System Programs, a more comprehensive evaluation of the programs is needed before any assessment of the programs can be made. At this point, the effectiveness of this type of reading program is unknown .

## 2.6 Education Program Comparability Assessment

Our  review  of  prison  education  programs  operating  in  state  corrections  systems  across  the United  States,  along  with  one  education  program  in  Israel,  has  classified  the  following  two education  programs  as  evidence-based:  GED-based  literacy  programs  and  post-secondary education  programs.  Every  meta-analysis  and  systematic  review  of  education  programs  we reviewed (see Appendix Table 2A) supports this classification. The question we now raise and attempt to answer here: Do these prison education programs look like the BOP programs we described at the outset?

This is a difficult question to definitively answer because the program evaluations we reviewed do not provide much detail on these programs. However, based on our preliminary review, BOP appears to be on firm ground in the classification of the Bureau Lit eracy Program (i.e., the BOP's GED program) and the Post-Secondary Education Program as evidence based programming.

The Bureau Literacy Program, which focuses on increasing literacy and preparing individuals for the GED examination, shares several features with the referenced GED-based literacy programs, to  include  use  of  the  TABE  to  assess  educational  needs/level  and  mandated  educational programming  for  individuals  who  lack  a  high  school  diploma  or  GED  certificate.  In  the  BOP, mandated programming requirements meet or extend requirements referenced in the research. For example, the BOP requires individuals to complete a minimum of 240 hours in the Bureau Literacy Program, whereas the state of Florida requires 150 hours of programming. In addition, curriculum for the Bureau Literacy Program is standardized, and quality assurance measures are in  place  to  support  consistency  across  institutions.  While  the  Bureau  Literacy  Program  does appear comparable to the programs found to be evidence based in our review, a noteworthy caveat exists. A 2011 report from the American Council on Education and GED Testing Service found GED pass rates in the BOP were lower than in most state correctional systems (Patterson, 2011). Specifically, the BOP's GED completion rate was 68.3%, below the national average of 75.1%.  Only  six  state  correctional  systems  obtained  lower  pass  rates -Alabama,  Georgia, Michigan, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and Utah. This report pre-dated significant revisions to the GED in 2014.

The BOP's Post -Secondary Education Program also appears comparable to programs described in the research. As with post-s econdary education programs referenced in our review, the BOP's Post-Secondary Education Program is offered in partnership with local colleges and universities, taught by certified instructors/faculty, consistent with community-based standards, and aimed a t obtaining an associate or bachelor's degree. Degree programs offered in the BOP also focus on the acquisition of marketable skills.

However, other components of BOP's education program are not on as firm empirical ground. We found no evidence to support the classification of three other BOP education programs Barton  Reading  and  Spelling  System,  Hooked  on  Phonics,  and  English-as-a-Second  Language Programs - as impacting recidivism reduction. Until evaluations of these BOP programs - or even evaluations of programs similar to these three BOP education programs - are conducted and available for review, they should not be designated as evidence-based programs with respect to recidivism reduction. However, we do find evidence to suggest the Barton Reading and Spelling System and Hooked on Phonics Programs may be promising programs in terms of their impact on reading skills, an intermediate outcome measure. Since these specific programs were not the subject of evaluations, this assessment is tentative at best.

## 2.7 Education Program Recommendations

In  addition  to  conducting  a  review  of  the  evaluation  research  and  offering  an  assessment  of whether specific  programs  should  be  designated  as  either  EBRR  or  PA  Programs,  the  Global

Corrections Group is tasked with 'informing future First Step Act program updates/revisions'. To this end, we offer the following recommendations.

Three BOP education programs could benefit from enhanced transparency regarding referral procedures and program admission criteria. Aggregated data related to the results of each step in  the  screening  process  for  the  Barton  Reading  and  Spelling  System  Program  would  aid  in demonstrating the program is offered to all individuals in need of this type of programming. It would also provide greater clarity related to each step in the screening process, i.e., the role of the Supervisor of Education's in the final screening step. Similarly, aggregated TABE data would aid  in  demonstrating  all  applicable  individuals  are  offered  the  Hooked  on  Phonics  Program. Finally,  aggregated  CASAS  data  would  demonstrate  all  individuals  who  lack  English  language fluency are offered the English-as-a-Second Language Program.

The issue of access to programs is raised in part due to the limited availability/enrollment in some education  programs,  i.e.,  the  Barton  Reading  and  Spelling  System  and  Hooked  on  Phonics Programs. While these programs have yet to be proven effective, it is likely there are individuals at all BOP institutions with a need for these very basic literacy skills. Once these programs are evaluated, incorporating them into policy is one way to ensure broader availability.  In addition, according to the most recent FSA Annual Report, the BOP has taken significant steps to increase availability by allocating an additional 23 positions for Special Education Teachers (Office of the Attorney General, 2023).

The BOP has policies related to the Bureau Literacy and English-as-a-Second Language Programs; however, these policies do not mandate the use of a standardized curriculum. If these policies are  updated  to  clearly  mandate  use  of  the  standardized  curriculum,  then  program  review guidelines used in operational and program reviews can be updated to address the use of the required curriculum. These updates should include incorporating the Barton Reading and Spelling System and Hooked on Phonics Programs into the applicable policy.

All the BOP education programs referenced above have immediate outcome measures which can inform program fidelity, i.e., individuals must successfully pass examinations to proceed through and complete the program. There are two additional fidelity measures at the BOP's disposal; however, it is not clear whether these measures are fully utilized. First, as noted above, if policy is updated  to  clearly  mandate  use  of  the  standardized  curriculum,  then  program  review guidelines  used  in  operational  and  program  reviews  could  be  updated  to  include  fidelity measures  specific  to  the  curriculum.  Second,  since  current  policy  requires  Supervisors  of Education to observe teachers in the classroom at least annually, program fidelity checklists could be incorporated into these observations.

The  BOP  has  plans  to  evaluate  the  Bureau  Literacy  and  Post-Secondary  Education  Programs. Independent  evaluations  of  these  programs  will  ensure  classification  of  these  programs  as evidence based is merited. If the BOP believes the Barton Reading and Spelling System, Hooked on Phonics, and  English-as-a-Second Language Programs may in fact be effective in reducing recidivism,  it  will  be  necessary  to  demonstrate  this  effectiveness  through  an  independent evaluation. Given the relatively small number of individuals who participate in these programs, evaluating the programs may be challenging.

## 2.8 Summary of Results

All  five  education  programs  examined  in  this  report  are  currently  classified  by  BOP  as  EBRR Programs.  Based  on  our  review  of  the  evaluation  research  conducted  on  these  programs published between 2000 and 2022, we find support for classifying two of these programs as EBRR Programs:  Bureau  Literacy  and  the  Post-Secondary  Education  Programs.  It  is  important  to recognize that these rankings are not based on evaluations of BOP's own programs; that body of evaluation  research  simply  does  not  exist.  Instead,  the  rankings  are  based  on  our  review  of evaluations of programs operating in state corrections systems across the United States, and/or in another country's correctional system. While these programs do appear to be comparable to the BOP programs based on our comparability review, it is recommended that each of these BOP programs be evaluated. We understand that BOP has plans to evaluate these programs in the future; but at present, there are no ongoing evaluations of these programs.

We found classification of the following three programs as EBRR Programs is not fully supported at this time: Barton Reading and Spelling System, Hooked on Phonics, and English-as-a-Second Language Programs.  However,  we  did  find  promising  effects  on  reading  skills  for  the  Barton Reading  and  Spelling  System  and  Hooked  on  Phonics  Programs,  such  that  the  BOP  might provisionally classify these programs as EBRR Programs. A provisional classification is necessary as neither BOP programs nor comparable programs operating at the state level have been fully evaluated. Until additional evaluations of these programs are conducted, and a body of quality evaluation research is available for review,  the classification should remain provisional. With respect  to  the  English-as-a-Second  Language  Program,  at  this  time,  there  is  no  evidence  to support classifying this program as an EBBR Program.

The table below provides a summary of the results of our research review.

| 1) Fizer  (2020)     | Trained Peer Tutors  in Adult Basic  Education (ABE)  program and GED  (Arizona: Red Rock  Correctional Center  [RRCC], a medium  custody private  prison operated by  CoreCivic) | RCT design randomly  assigned 70 incarcerated  individuals to treatment and  control groups: there were 2  treatment groups: 1 ABE class  with tutor(n=15), and 1 GED  class with tutor(n=20); and 2  control groups (1 control  group of ABE [n=15] and 1  control group of GED [n=20]).  Note: 'A total of six tutors  were involved, and through a  process of a rotation process  based on subject expertise,  the treatment classes were  provided five trained tutors  to assist the instructor, which  served as the intervention.  All tutors completed a 27- hour tutor training program  developed locally by the  education staff and focused  on instructional skills and  communication. ' (24) | 4  - RCT research design used for  a small, 90-day pilot study. Small  sample size is a limitation, but  qualitative interviews with  participants in both groups  provided insights to support the  pilot test quantitative results  presented. | The study was conducted in one medium security  prison and presented preliminary evidence that  tutors in the classroom provide more support for  learning than computer-based support.   According to the author: 'This study found that a  group of ABE students who had exposure to the  use of trained peer tutors for up to 90 days  performed better on a post-skills exam (TABE)  than those ABE students who did not have tutors  assigned to assist in their learning process. The  difference in the mean score values between  these groups on the TABE was statistically  significant (p = .03). This difference was not  found with the GED control and treatment  groups. The distinct difference between the ABE  and GED classes, besides their academic  functioning levels, was that the students in both  the control and treatment GED classes all had  access to a computerized learning program that  was set to each student's skill level ' (30) . |

None of these  benefits accrued to inmates who started but did  not complete these programs/classes. ' (515) |

| 9)  Roessger  et al.  (2021) | GED and Vocational  programs  (Arkansas) | Retrospective quasi- experimental study. Cohort  of individuals released from  Arkansas prison between  2005 and 2013 (n=32,174)  who entered prison without a  GED or high school diploma  were included in the  recidivism analyses; a  different cohort was used for  the post-release employment  analyses (2008-2016;  n=40,667). Within both data  sets, individuals who  completed either a GED or a  vocational training program  were compared on these two  outcomes with individuals  who did not complete these  programs. | 3 -  Adequate research design  with identified nonequivalent  comparison group differences  examined as moderators. Two  demographic variables were  identified as significant  moderators: age and race (see  p.24-25). In addition, individuals  who participated in GED and Voc.  Ed. Programs were included in  the comparison group along with  nonparticipants. Researchers  also examined the impact of  multiple program completion. | Completion of GED or Vocational programs was  found to significantly reduce recidivism  (reincarceration) risk: 'Among inmates without  high school diplomas and GEDs at intake, those  completing GED programs had a 4% lower three- year recidivism rate than those not completing,  and those completing VOC programs had a 10%  lower three-year recidivism rate than those not  completing' (34). Significant improvement in  employment post-release was found for GED  completers, but vocational program completers  did not show these gains. However, these overall  findings changed when age and race were  included as moderators. Both sentencing  variables and participation/completion of other  prison programs moderated the effects of GED  and Voc. Ed. Programs with a significant effect on  recidivism and employment outcomes included  anger  management: 'Completers of both GED  and anger management programs had a 33.3%  lower relative probability of recidivating within  six months, a30.8% lower relative probability of  recidivating within a year, and a 22.7% lower  relative probability of recidivating within three  years' (32).  Substance abuse education:  'completers of both GED and substance abuse  education programs had a 35.0% lower relative  probability of recidivating within six months, a  31.9% lower relative probability of recidivating  within a year, and a 24.1% lower relative  probability of recidivating within three years' |

The researchers  noted the lack of program  (fidelity) data as a limitation.  They offered the following: 'It is  likely that important variations  exist between institutions in  terms of program structure,  organization, and other  potentially important factors that  may affect the strength of the  relationship between PSE and  recidivism.' | The authors concluded that 'the results of the  quantitative study provide mixed results in terms  of PSE's impact on post -release recidivism. In two  states, PSE was associated with a decrease in  recidivism, while in a third it was associated with  an increase. However, only one of these effects - a decrease in recidivism - was statistically  significant. ' (13) Researchers note the following:  'The reduction in recidivism risk attributable to  PSE for Indiana (-3.40%) and Massachusetts (- 14.19%) were similar to those shown in the  simple group comparison (Indiana: -2.85%;  Massachusetts: -13.9%). The impact of PSE on  recidivism for the New Mexico sample was much  stronger (-24.61%) than the difference between  the PSE and non-PSE groups (New Mexico: - 5.54%). The difference in results suggests that  key differences in recidivism risk (excepting PSE  or non-PSE status) remained despite attempts to  balance the groups. |

In  addition, no details were  provided on the decision to  ignore the subgroups of GED  program participants who failed  the GED exam, including how  many times a participant can  take the exam while in the GED  program.   | 'Sixty -four percent of non-GED participants  recidivated once released, compared with 51% of  GED participants' (381). They also note that  'leaving prison with at least the equivalent of a  high school diploma significantly improves the  chances that one will not recidivate, even after  considering the other risk predictors in offender  research. Other factors that help to mitigate  recidivism rates include race (e.g., white), serving  a shorter sentence, age at arrest (e.g., older as  opposed to younger), violent offense charges,  and being married at the time of one's arrest '  .
