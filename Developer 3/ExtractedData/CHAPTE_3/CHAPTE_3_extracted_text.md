## INTRODUCTION

In  this  project,  the Global  Corrections  Group  (GCG)  was  tasked  with  conducting  a  review  of evaluation research on the effectiveness of Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) programming and providing an assessment of whether specific programs should be designated as either EvidenceBased Recidivism Reduction (EBRR) Programs or Productive Activity (PA) Programs. In addition, the GCG was tasked with developing descriptions of each (First Step Act) FSA approved program and offering recommendations to inform future FSA program updates and revisions. This chapter summarizes our program description and literature review findings and concludes with general recommendations related to programming in the BOP. In addition, program and category-specific recommendations are found within each applicable chapter.

As noted in Chapter 1, the BOP has continued to add new programs to its FSA Approved Programs Guide, but the GCG contract was limited to a review of 88 FSA-approved programs contained in the guide as of November 15, 2022 (BOP, 2022). The most recent edition of the FSA Approved Programs Guide, issued in October 2023, contains 21 programs not included in the contract -the BOP has classified 11 of these new programs as EBRR Programs and 10 as PA Programs (BOP, 2023). We can offer no opinion on the classification of these programs as EBRR or PA Programs.

As a reminder, we assigned BOP programs to one of thirteen programming categories (see the graphic below). A breakdown of the programs in each category is contained in each applicable chapter, and the Appendix in Chapter 1 of this report also includes a breakdown of the programs in each category.

## 15.1  Program Description Findings

In this section, we provide an overview of key findings related to the development of program descriptions  for  each  of  the  BOP's  88  FSA -approved  programs.  Findings  about  individual programs are contained in the applicable core chapters of this report. In this section of our report, we  offer  general  conclusions  related  to  needs  assessment  procedures,  policy  and  guidance, staffing, program incentives, the scope of programming, program availability and participation, and program dosage.

## 15.1.1  Needs Assessment Procedures

The Standardized Prisoner Assessment for Reduction in Criminality (SPARC13) is the BOP's needs assessment system (RSD, 2022). SPARC-13 assesses incarcerated individuals on 13 need domains; some of these domains are consistent with criminogenic needs (e.g., antisocial peers, substance use), others are not (e.g., finance/poverty, medical). Needs assessment results are intended to inform program referrals; however, in our review we found the relationship between identified needs and programming referrals to be underdeveloped.

While we address this issue in more detail in the core programming chapters, we offer a few examples here. First, needs assessment procedures are not well-described in policy. Program Statement 5400.01 First Step Act Needs Assessment is quite brief, referring staff to Sallyport for additional guidance. As noted in previous chapters, a lack of policy support impacts program integrity, as staff cannot be held fully accountable for conducting assessments as intended. In addition, the needs assessment procedures outlined in guidance are incomplete, as they do not address  the  full  range  of  assessments  used  in  program  referrals.    For  example,  screening procedures for the Sex Offender Treatment Programs are outlined in Program Statement 5324.10 Sex Offender Programs , but they are not referenced in the broader needs assessment policy. In the context of the FSA-approved programs, they are only noted to meet cognitions and antisocial peers needs, as opposed to a very specific need to address sexual deviancy issues (PSB, 2013). As  another  example,  the  approach  to  assessing  trauma  needs  in  the  Resolve  Program,  as described in the Program Statement 5330.11 Psychology Treatment Programs ,  is  not  entirely consistent with procedures outlined in the broader needs assessment policy.  The broader needs assessment  policy  describes  procedures  which  rely  solely  on  a  history  of  trauma  for  need identification. However, there are differences in personal resilience across individuals, and not everyone a history of trauma needs or wants intervention in this area. The needs assessment model within the Resolve Program is more appropriate, where treatment services are provided when a trauma-related mental disorder is diagnosed.

Second, the relationship between a need and the program(s) identified as meeting this need is not always clear. For example, the National Parenting from Prison Program is noted to address a family/parenting  need;  however,  the  family/parenting  need  assessment  is  focused  on  family dysfunction, whereas it would seem any individual with minor children could theoretically benefit from participation in the National Parenting from Prison Program. As another example, a large number of programs are noted to address a cognitions need, but as defined by the BOP this need appears to focus on antisocial cognitions, which the content of these programs did not address in all instances.

Third, we noted procedures for periodically re-assessing needs are not clearly articulated. That is, it is unclear whether the successful completion of a program results in a reassessment of need and/or elimination of needs targeted by the program. Many programs do not appear to include post-program outcome measures, e.g., knowledge tests, skills demonstrations, or psychological assessments, to demonstrate resolution of a need and support program fidelity.

## 15.1.2  Policy and Guidance

As we noted in Chapter 1, policy support , in the form of the BOP's program statements, heightens program fidelity. A program such as the Residential Drug Abuse Program, which is described in detail  in  policy,  is  significantly  more  likely  to  be  implemented  as  intended  because  staff  are provided with clear direction and held accountable for any deviations from policy. The BOP's FSA -approved programs differ significantly in terms of policy support.

Nineteen of the BOP 's 88 FSA approved programs have strong policy support, with a program statement clearly outlining the referral procedures, organization, structure, staffing, and content of the program. For an additional seven programs, policy support exists, but is limited to a general description  of  the  framework  for  the  program,  with  no  reference  to  a  specific  program curriculum. More than 70 % of the BOP's FSA -approved programs have very little policy support. Indirect references to some of these programs can be found in policies requiring programming for women, veterans, aging individuals, and individuals with disabilities, but these references do not  provide  any  details  related  to  referral  procedures,  organization,  structure,  staffing,  and content. These policies simply note the frequency with which this type of population-specific programming must be offered. Lastly, and most concerningly, 17 FSA-approved programs are not referenced in policy at all, either directly or indirectly, including 4 programs the BOP has classified as EBRR Programs -Barton Reading and Spelling System, Hooked on Phonics, Money Smart for Adults, and the Threshold Program.

This lack of policy support adversely impacts program fidelity. Chapter 1 of this report includes a full  listing  of  relevant  policies,  and  copies  of  these  policies  are  available  on  the  BOP's  public website at www.bop.gov.

## 15.1.3  Staffing

In the BOP's Central Office, t he Reentry Services Division (RSD) bears the greatest responsibility for programs contained in the FSA Approved Program Guide, administering over 70 programs (BOP,  2023).  Other  Central  Office  divisions  with  some  degree  of  programming  oversight responsibilities include the Correctional Programs Division (CPD), Health Services Division (HSD), and Federal Prison Industries (FPI). In the BOP's institutions, some programs have dedicated staff, whereas other programs are described as potentially facilitated by a variety staff, contractors, and/or volunteers. Programs with dedicated staff are offered on a more consistent basis, aligned with policy requires for their delivery. In addition, these dedicated staff are more likely to have the training and expertise necessary to effectively deliver the program. Some BOP programs are supported  by  required,  robust  staff  training,  whereas  other  programs  offer  training  via  a facilitator guide or no substantial training at all.

## 15.1.4  Program Incentives

The  BOP  offers  a  variety  of  incentives  for  participation  in  FSA-approved  programs,  e.g., achievement awards, telephone and visitation privileges, preferred housing, and in the case of the Residential Drug Abuse Program a sentence reduction of up to 12-months (RSD, 2021; PSB, 2016). The most noteworthy FSA-related incentive is the opportunity to earn time credits for successfully participating in and completing approved EBRR or PA Programs (CPB, 2023). These time credits may be applied toward prelease custody or early transfer to supervised release.

As noted in the most recent FSA Annual Report, the U.S. Department of Justice has issued a time credits rule, which details procedures for the assignment of time credits (Office of the Attorney General, 2023). This rule requires individuals to 'opt out' of programs rather than 'opt in' to programs.  If  an  individual  is  eligible  to  earn  time  credits  and  they  have  not  opted  out  of  a recommended program, they are earning time credits, regardless of whether they are currently participating in a program. Individuals earn time credits for any month in which they are in ' opt in ' status. This rule also allows individuals to earn time credits for participation in unstructured PA  Programs,  i.e.,  non-FSA  approved  PA  Programs,  such  as  hobby  crafts,  social  visiting,  and institution work programs (CPB, 2023). This approach to earned time credits effectively severs the  link  between  program  participation  and  time  credits,  which  in  our  view  appears  to  be inconsistent with the intention of the FSA. In Chapter 1 of this report, we provided a summary of the estimated minimum earned time credits associated with each FSA approved program.

## 15.1.5  Scope of Programming

The BOP's programming offerings are quite comprehensive, addressing a wide variety of topics, needs, and special populations. The BOP's efforts to ensure all potential programming needs are addressed has resulted in a broad range of programming opportunities. Unfortunately, many of these programs lack empirical support, as we will address in the next section of this summary. Nevertheless, the BOP's efforts are commendable, and we can identify very few potential gaps in programming.

## 15.1.6  Program Availability and Participation

The BOP's FSA -Approved Programs Guide gives the impression programming is widely available across many institutions, with 59 programs noted as available at all institutions. However, our review found many of these programs were not necessarily always available in all institutions. A more  accurate  statement  would  be  to  indicate  these  programs could be  available  in  all institutions.  For  example,  at  the  close  of  FY  2023, only  10  programs  in  the guide  were  being offered at 75% or more of the BOP's institutions: Anger Management, Apprenticeship Training, Bureau Literacy Program, Certification Course Training, English-as-a-Second Language, Money Smart for Adults, National Parenting from Prison Program, Nonresidential Drug Abuse Program, Threshold Program, and Vocational Training Program. In addition, at the close of FY 2023, 28% of the BOP's 88 FSA-approved programs were offered in less than 10% of its institutions.

We also found program participation to be more limited than anticipated. At the close of FY 2023, 37.5% of programs had enrollments of less than 150 participants BOP-wide. In addition, three programs were not being offered to anyone in the BOP at the close of FY2023: CBT for Eating Disorders, FPI Lean Basics Training, and Pu'a Foundation Reentry Programs.  Looking at program participation  and  completions  since  implementation  of  the  FSA,  we  find  relatively  low participation and completion rates for several EBRR Programs. For example, an estimated 18% of individuals with an anger/hostility need have participated in the Anger Management Program and an estimated 2% of individuals with a sexual offense history have participated in one of the two Sex Offender Treatment Programs. Programs with the highest participation rates tend to fall into one of two categories: (1) program offerings explicitly required by policy, such as the Bureau Literacy, Drug Education, and Federal Prison Industries Programs or (2) very low dose programs which  are  easily  implemented,  e.g.,  Brain  Health  as  You  Age  (5  hours),  Health  and  Wellness Through the Lifespan (3 hours), and Talking with Your Doctor: A Guide for Older Adults (5 hours) Programs. To our understanding program availability is limited.

## 15.1.7  Program Dosage

A significant number of the BOP's FSA -Approved programs are quite brief; 22% of the programs consist of 10 hours or less of programming.  For the 38 programs the BOP has classified as EBRR Programs, 42% consist of 50 hours or less of programming.  Given what we know about program dosage, these programs are unlikely to have a significant impact. The BOP's most recent FSA -Approved  Programs  Guide  no  longer  indicates  the  number  of  programming  hours  for  all programs; however, the guide does indicate approximately 17% of programs consist of at least 100 hours of programming (BOP, 2023). These programs are more likely to have a significant impact on behavior.

## 15.2  Literature Review Findings

In  this  section,  we  provide  an  overview  of  findings  from  our  study  identification  procedures, research design quality rankings, and study quality rankings. At the conclusion of this overview, we provide a table detailing our findings for each of the BOP's 88 FSA -approved programs.

## 15.2.1  Study Identification Findings

In support of our literature review process, we created databases specific to each of 13 identified programming categories.  To build each database, we first examined all published meta-analyses and  systematic  reviews  of  relevant  prison  programming  published  during  our  review  period (2000-present). The next step in our study identification process was to determine whether these meta-analyses and systematic reviews perhaps missed relevant evaluations due to the search procedures employed or excluded them from their review due to their study inclusion criteria. To address these possible omissions, we searched a series of electronic databases for the period 2000-2022. Based on the nature of the programs under review, we used topic-specific terms for this systematic search. Topic-specific study selection procedures are described in detail within each relevant chapter.

Based on our review of the studies included in meta-analyses and systematic reviews and the results of our electronic database searches, we identified a set of program evaluations meeting our review criteria. Of note, most of the evaluations we reviewed did not meet our criteria and were  excluded.  These  evaluations  are  described  within  each  relevant  chapter,  and  tables summarizing the meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and individual evaluations are contained in the chapters as well. Across the 13 programming categories, we identified 92 meta-analysis and systematic  reviews  and  286  unique  individual  studies  to  be  included  in  our  analysis.  Some programming categories provided us with a wealth of data to review, whereas other categories were  less  well-researched.  A  breakdown  of  the  sources  identified  within  each  programming category is provided below:

## 15.2.2  Research Design Quality Rankings Findings

One of  the  most  consistent  findings  from  previous  meta-analyses  and  systematic  reviews  of corrections programs is the more rigorous the evaluation design employed, the less likely we are to  find  support  for  these  programs.  To  address  this  issue,  we  have  reviewed  and  ranked  the research design quality of each of the evaluations included in this analysis using the Scientific Methods Scale (Sherman et al., 1998). As a reminder, a copy of the Scientific Methods Scale is provided below:

## Scientific Methods Scale

Level 5 Well-designed randomized control trials (RCTs) of corrections programs.

| Level 4   | RCTs with some design or analysis flaws, and/or small sample size; well-designed quasi-experiments  with strong statistical controls and closely matched treatment and control groups.                                     |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Level 3   | Well-designed quasi-experiments with comparable treatment and control groups and appropriate  statistical analyses; adequately designed quasi-experiments with some statistical controls used to  address non-equivalence. |
| Level 2   | Quasi-experiment with comparison group included, but limited equivalence and/or inadequate  statistical controls in place.                                                                                                 |
| Level 1   | Non-experimental design with only correlational evidence.                                                                                                                                                                  |

Using the Scientific Methods Scale, we ranked each of the program evaluations on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the designation for studies with the weakest research designs and 5 being the designation for studies with the strongest research designs. Each study's ranking was assigned by the research team using the above scoring criteria, which has been adapted slightly from the original  classification  model  (Sherman  et  al.,  1998).  A  breakdown  of  the  quality  rankings  by programming category for the 286 individual studies we reviewed is provided in the table below.

As this  breakdown reveals, relatively few studies were ranked at the highest level of quality, representing only 6% of the studies reviewed.  When we focus on studies ranked at level three

or  higher  -  our  review  standard,  we  found  just  under  50%  of  the  studies  reviewed  met  this criterion. This relative lack of quality research in corrections underscores the need for additional well-controlled studies in this area.

## 15.2.3  Program Effectiveness Findings

In this section, we provide an overview of the results of our systematic review of the literature for prison-based programming.

## For programs currently classified as EBRR programs , we found the following:

The in-prison outcomes of 6 programs were classified as effective, 12 programs were classified as promising, 2 programs were classified as having mixed effects, 2 programs were classified as ineffective, and 16 were classified as having unknown effects.

The post-release outcomes of 4 programs were classified as effective, 4 programs were classified as promising, 3 programs were classified as having mixed effects, 1 program was classified as ineffective, and 26 were classified as having unknown effects.

Based on our review of the literature, we find the BOP to be on firm ground in classifying 6 of the 88 FSA-approved programs as EBRR Programs based on empirical support for their ability to effectively address one or more of the identified in-prison or post-release outcome measures.

Based on our review of the literature we find the BOP can provisionally classify an additional 19 programs as EBRR Programs, based on promising empirical support for their effectiveness in addressing one or more of the identified in-prison or post-release outcome measures.

For the remaining 13 programs the BOP has classified as EBRR Programs, we did not find sufficient support to make this classification.

For  programs  classified  as  PA  Programs , the  in-prison  outcomes  of  these  programs  were classified as unknown in most instances, because of a lack of available research evidence. One program - Victim Impact: Listen and Learn - was identified for reclassification as a provisional EBRR Program.

Our review found a lack of evidence - either favorable or unfavorable - for many of the BOP's FSA-approved programs. This lack of evidence underscores the need for BOP to conduct program evaluations. In part, this lack of evidence stems from the fact many of the BOP's programs are developed in-house, such that no other entities have evaluated the program. Consequently, the burden  falls  on  the  BOP  to  evaluate  its  own  programs  to  ensure  their  effectiveness.  In  the meantime, the remaining programs may be classified as PA Programs. However, the BOP may want to consider removing a portion of these programs from the FSA Approved Programs Guide based on one or more of the following issues: (1) the reduced likelihood of their effectiveness

based on low program dosage; (2) the lack of a defined curriculum, and/or (3) the lack of demand for the program. Specific recommendations in this regard are contained in the core programming chapters of this report.

The below tables summarize our findings for each of the 88 FSA approved programs.

## 15.3  Recommendations

In  addition  to  describing  BOP  programs,  conducting  a review  of  the  evaluation  research,  and offering  an  assessment  of  whether  specific  programs  should  be  designated  as  either  EBRR Programs or PA Programs, we were tasked with offering recommendations to inform future FSA program updates/revisions. Our recommendations include program-specific recommendations, category-specific  recommendations,  and  more  general  recommendations  to  broadly  improve programming in the agency.

Informed  by  our  understanding  of  BOP  programs  and  our  review  of  the  literature,  our recommendations focus on nine critical areas:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Increasing program availability

Modifying programs to increase effectiveness and efficiency

<!-- image -->

Incorporating programs into policy

<!-- image -->

Identifying intermediate outcome measures

<!-- image -->

In this summary, we offer 20 general recommendations to broadly improve programming in the agency. In addition, category and program-specific recommendations can be found within each core chapter. Our general recommendations are as follows:

## 15.3.1  Strengthening Program Referrals

- 1. Update Program  Statement  5400.01  FSA  Needs  Assessment to  incorporate  enhanced needs  assessment  procedures.  Specifically,  we  recommend  strengthening  needs  assessment procedures  in  a  variety  of  domains,  e.g.,  finance/poverty,  work,  mental  health,  trauma, cognitions  (i.e.,  sexual  disorder  needs).  In  addition,  we  recommend  greater  clarity  in  policy regarding program referral procedures, program prioritization, the reassessment of needs, and procedures for determining a need has been sufficiently addressed.

- 2. Create  a  user-friendly  dashboard  to  monitor  program  demand,  participation,  and completion. This dashboard should be available at the departmental, institution, regional, and national levels, as well as to external stakeholders. Ready access to this information would better inform  program  offerings,  referrals,  and  resource  allocations.  Absent  such  a  dashboard,  the agency will lack a clear mechanism for directing programming resources in the most appropriate manner.

## 15.3.2  Increasing Program Availability

- 3. Increase the availability of programs identified as effective or promising. The BOP has several programs which we have found to be effective or promising based on our review of the literature. A portion of these programs are not widely available or are not available to the degree necessary  to  serve  all  individuals  with  applicable  needs.  Reallocating  staff  to  the  delivery  of effective and/or promising programs will represent a more costeffective use of the BOP's limited programming resources.

## 15.3.3  Modifying Programs to Increase Effectiveness and Efficiency

- 4. Bundle  programs  to  enhance  program  dosage.  As  noted  in  our  review,  many  BOP programs  are  low  dose  programs,  which  are  less  likely  to  elicit  lasting  behavior  change. Combining related programs into a single integrated program is one way to increase dosage.  For example, the Basic Cognitive Skills and Criminal Thinking Programs can be combined into a single program, particularly given the fact Basic Cognitive Skills is considered a prerequisite for the Criminal Thinking Program and the Criminal Thinking Program is an intervention targeted to the 'big four' criminogenic needs.
- 5. Offer more opportunities for skills practice within existing programs to increase dosage and as a means to assess intermediate outcomes. As noted in our review, several BOP programs lack well-developed completion criteria; that is, attendance and participation alone is sufficient for program completion. Incorporating a skills practice component to applicable programs would both  serve  to  increase  program  dosage  and  offer  an  immediate  measure  of  program effectiveness in the acquisition of skills.
- 6. Offer  periodic  programs  refreshers  to  strengthen  existing  programs.  Federal  prison sentences can be lengthy, such that program gains may not be sustained over time. To increase the likelihood program skills are retained, the BOP may want to offer periodic 'booster sessions' in support of continued use of key skills, such as the skill of using RSAs developed in the BOP's CBT programs.

## 15.3.4  Refining Program Offerings

- 7. Streamline BOP  programming  to  eliminate ineffective programs, programs with underdeveloped curriculums, low dosage programs, and programs with limited demand.  Doing so  would allow the BOP to  make  more cost-effective use of limited  programming resources, bolster program  fidelity, provide enhanced  staff training, and develop clearer referral procedures. Simply put, the BOP should value quality over quantity.

## 15.3.5  Incorporating Programs into Policy

- 8. Incorporate programs directly into policy to enhance program fidelity.  As we have noted throughout this report, relatively few BOP programs have policy  in place to support program fidelity. When programs are fully addressed in policy, and supported with dedicated staff, the BOP finds success. For example, t he BOP's approach to RDAP can serve as a model, i.e., a welldeveloped, detailed policy, program review guidelines, and program certification procedures.

## 15.3.6  Identifying Intermediate Outcome Measures

- 9. Incorporate  immediate  outcome  measures  into  all  programs.  As  suggested  above, attendance  and  participation  alone  should  not  result  in  program  completion.  Immediate outcome  metrics  could  significantly  aid  the  agency  in  evaluating  program  effectiveness. For example, immediate outcome measures might include knowledge tests, skills demonstrations, fitness checks, and/or re-administration of needs assessment measures.
- 10. Incorporate  intermediate  outcome  measures  into  all  programs.  Relying  on  recidivism reduction alone as an outcome measure requires significant time and resources. Intermediate outcome measures can aid the BOP in evaluating program effectiveness and continuing needs. For  example,  intermediate  outcome  measures  might  include  disciplinary  records,  restrictive housing placement, Financial Responsibility Program participation, work performance appraisals, crisis interventions, suicide risk assessments, program participation.

## 15.3.7  Monitoring Program Fidelity

- 11. Create  a  program  fidelity  tracking  system  based  on  program-specific  Program  Review findings. Doing so would allow the agency to identify at-risk programs and programs in need of additional staff training or support.

- 12. Encourage regular program observations by supervisors, with the use of fidelity checklists. Program review findings can artificially support fidelity as staff prepare well in advance for these reviews. Ensuring programs are assessed more routinely will increase quality.

## 15.3.8  Classifying Programs Appropriately

- 13. Ensure programs are appropriately classified as either EBRR Programs or PA Programs. Programs  we  have  identified  as  effective  can  be  reasonably  classified  as  EBRR  Programs. Programs we have identified as promising can be provisionally classified as EBRR Programs until an evaluation can be completed within the BOP. Absent this empirical support, a program should not be classified as EBRR Program. Adhering to this standard will require the BOP to reclassify 17 programs from EBRR Programs to PA Programs. In addition, the BOP can consider provisionally reclassifying  one  program from PA Programs to EBRR Programs based on our review (Victim Impact: Listen and Learn Program).
- 14. Create an Expert Advisory and Accreditation Panel (1) to review and classify any proposed EBRR and PA programs, including both internally and externally developed programs; and (2) to conduct bi-annual reviews of existing EBRR and PA programs to ensure they remain appropriately classified.

## 15.3.9  Conducting Regularly Scheduled Program Evaluations

- 15. Evaluate all BOP programs to ensure they are appropriately classified as EBRR Programs. Very  few  BOP  programs  have  been  directly  evaluated.  More  recently,  the  BOP  has  made  a commitment to program evaluation with evaluations underway for several programs and a plan for future evaluations in place. We encourage the BOP to proceed with this evaluation plan. Given the resources dedicated to BOP programs, ensuring their effectiveness should be a high priority.
- 16. Increase  BOP  subject  matter  experts'  awareness  of  relevant  correctional  programs literature. While evaluating BOP programs is vitally important, so is staying current with research in other correctional organizations. There is merit in establishing a procedure, perhaps within ORE, to provide subject matter experts with copies of any significant new research. In the interim, within each chapter, we offer a list of relevant meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and individual studies which may inform future program development. We also provide a database with links to copies of each study.
- 17. Conduct a series of evaluations of programs in residential reentry centers, day reporting centers, and community treatment services to determine short-term, in-program effects as well as post-release outcomes of these programs.

- 18. For  programs  with  a  significant  aftercare  component,  extend  program  evaluations  to include  an  evaluation  of  community  treatment  services  and  any  relevant  services  offered  in residential reentry centers or day reporting centers. In addition, consider partnering with U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services to further evaluate the impact of BOP programming during a term of supervision.
- 19. Conduct a series of evaluations to determine the impact of multiple program participation on both in-prison and post-release outcomes.
- 20. In all the above evaluations, require program evaluators to utilize short-term (i.e., up to one year post-custody) post-release outcome measures, including -but not limited to recidivism (arrest and/or conviction). Doing so will support evaluation findings relevant to BOP programming, as opposed to environmental/community influences  which may  mask or alter programming effects over time.
