## 📌 Introduction

Recidivism refers to the tendency of previously incarcerated individuals to reoffend and return to prison. High recidivism rates indicate inefficiencies in rehabilitation programs, leading to prison overcrowding. 

### 🚨 Problem Statement

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) faces challenges in implementing the First Step Act (FSA) due to:
- **Staff shortages**
- **Technology limitations**
- **Budget constraints**
- **Program validation inefficiencies**
- **Lack of a centralized system** for program evaluation  

### 🛠 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **web-based validation platform** for evaluating recidivism reduction programs. The system will leverage **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)** to improve decision-making and streamline workflows.

## 🎯 Goals & Objectives

- **Automate** program evaluation using AI/ML techniques.
- **Predict** the effectiveness of recidivism reduction programs based on historical data.
- **Enhance decision-making** through interactive dashboards and reports.
- **Reduce manual validation efforts** and streamline BOP workflows.

## 🏗 Project Requirements

The system must include:
- **Data Mining & Collection System**
- **Machine Learning Models for Prediction**
- **Data Visualization & Reporting Tools**
- **Compliance with Federal Security Standards** (FedRAMP, NIST 800-53)
