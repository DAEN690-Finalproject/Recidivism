"ex-prisoners succeed and some don’t, we know that a lack of education and skills is one key",,,,,,,,
reason. This is why correctional education programs—whether academically or vocationally,,,,,,,,
focused—are a key service provided in correctional facilities across the nation. But do such,,,,,,,,
correctional education programs actually work? We care about the answer both because we,,,,,,,,

Introduction,,,,,,,,
It is challenging to prepare offenders with the needed vocational skills and education to be,,,,,,,,
"successful in reintegrating back into society. Offenders, on average, are less educated than the",,,,,,,,
"general  population. For example, in 2004,  approximately 36  percent  of  individuals  in state",,,,,,,,
prisons had attained less than a high school education compared with 19 percent of the general,,,,,,,,
"U.S. population age 16 and over. In addition to having lower levels of educational attainment,",,,,,,,,
"offenders often lack vocational skills and a steady history of employment, which is a significant",,,,,,,,
challenge for individuals returning from prison to local communities. And the dynamics of,,,,,,,,
"prison entry and reentry make it hard for this population to accumulate meaningful, sustained",,,,,,,,
"employment experience. Finally, the stigma of having a felony conviction on one’s record is a",,,,,,,,
key barrier to postrelease employment.,,,,,,,,
"On April 9, 2008, the Second Chance Act (Public Law 110-199) (SCA) was signed into",,,,,,,,
law. This important piece of legislation was designed to improve outcomes for individuals who,,,,,,,,
"are incarcerated, most of whom will ultimately return to communities upon release. The SCA’s",,,,,,,,
grant programs are funded and administered by the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) within,,,,,,,,
"the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). In 2010, funding was set aside, for the first time under",,,,,,,,
"the SCA, to conduct a comprehensive study of correctional education. OJP’s Bureau of Justice",,,,,,,,
Assistance  (BJA)  awarded  the  RAND  Corporation  a  cooperative  agreement  to  comprehen-,,,,,,,,
sively examine the current state of correctional education for incarcerated adults and juveniles,,,,,,,,
"and where it is headed, which correctional education programs are effective, and how effective",,,,,,,,
programs can be implemented across different settings. One central task in that effort was to,,,,,,,,
comprehensively review the scientific literature and conduct a meta-analysis to synthesize the,,,,,,,,
findings from multiple studies about the effectiveness of correctional education programs in,,,,,,,,
helping to reduce recidivism and improve employment outcomes for incarcerated adults within,,,,,,,,
U.S. state prisons.,,,,,,,,
"In this report, we present the findings from our meta-analysis, which will inform policy-",,,,,,,,
"makers, educators, and correctional education administrators interested in understanding the",,,,,,,,
association between correctional education and reductions in recidivism and improvements in,,,,,,,,
employment and other outcomes.,,,,,,,,
"To  prepare  for  the  meta-analysis,  we  first  conducted  a  comprehensive  literature  search",,,,,,,,
for  published  and  unpublished  studies  released  between  1980  and  2011  that  examined  the,,,,,,,,
relationship between correctional education participation and inmate outcomes. We focused,,,,,,,,
exclusively on studies published in English of correctional education programs in the United,,,,,,,,
States that included an academic and/or vocational curriculum with a structured instructional,,,,,,,,
"component. A scientific review panel abstracted data, and the quality of the research design",,,,,,,,
xvi    Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
was rated using the Maryland Scientific Methods Scale and the U.S. Department of Educa-,,,,,,,,
tion’s What Works Clearinghouse rating scheme. Studies that met our eligibility criteria in,,,,,,,,
"terms of intervention type, research design, and outcomes and that rated a 2 or higher on the",,,,,,,,
Maryland Scientific Methods Scale were included in the meta-analysis.,,,,,,,,
We used meta-analytic techniques to synthesize the effects of correctional education pro-,,,,,,,,
grams administered to adults across multiple studies. As with previous meta-analyses in this,,,,,,,,
"area, our focus was largely on recidivism, because it is the outcome most often used in the lit-",,,,,,,,
"erature. However, we also examined whether participating in a correctional education program",,,,,,,,
was associated with an increase in labor force participation and whether participating in a cor-,,,,,,,,
rectional education program with a computer-assisted instructional component was associated,,,,,,,,
"with gains in achievement test scores. In addition, we conducted a cost analysis comparing the",,,,,,,,
findings into a broader context.,,,,,,,,
Results,,,,,,,,
Relationship Between Correctional Education Programs and Recidivism,,,,,,,,
Our meta-analytic findings provide additional support for the premise that receiving correc-,,,,,,,,
tional education while incarcerated reduces an individual’s risk of recidivating after release.,,,,,,,,
"After examining the higher-quality research studies, we found that, on average, inmates who",,,,,,,,
participated in correctional education programs had 43 percent lower odds of recidivating than,,,,,,,,
inmates who did not. These results were consistent even when we included the lower-quality,,,,,,,,
age points for those who participate in correctional education programs versus those who do,,,,,,,,
"not. This reduction is somewhat greater than what had been previously reported by Wilson,",,,,,,,,
"Gallagher, and MacKenzie (2000), which showed an average reduction in recidivism of about",,,,,,,,
"11 percentage points. Using more recent studies and ones of higher quality, our findings com-",,,,,,,,
"plement the results published by Wilson, Gallagher, and MacKenzie (2000), Aos, Miller, and",,,,,,,,
"Drake (2006), and MacKenzie (2006) and provides further support to the assertion that cor-",,,,,,,,
rectional education participants have lower rates of recidivism than nonparticipants.,,,,,,,,
"Given the high percentage of state prison inmates who have not completed high school,",,,,,,,,
participation  in  high  school/general  education  development  (GED)  programs  was  the  most,,,,,,,,
common approach to educating inmates in the studies we examined. Focusing only on stud-,,,,,,,,
"ies that examined this kind of program relative to no correctional education, we found that",,,,,,,,
inmates who participated in high school/GED programs had 30 percent lower odds of recidi-,,,,,,,,
"vating than those who had not. In general, studies that included adult basic education (ABE),",,,,,,,,
"high  school/GED,  postsecondary  education,  and/or  vocational  training  programs  showed  a",,,,,,,,
"reduction in recidivism. However, we could not disentangle the effects of these different types",,,,,,,,
"of educational programs, because inmates could have participated in multiple programs, and",,,,,,,,
the amount of time that they spent in any given program was rarely reported.,,,,,,,,
Relationship Between Correctional Education Programs and Employment,,,,,,,,
"When we look at the relationship between correctional education and postrelease employment,",,,,,,,,
our meta-analyses found—using the full set of studies—that the odds of obtaining employment,,,,,,,,
postrelease among inmates who participated in correctional education (either academic or vocational,,,,,,,,
,Summary    xvii,,,,,,,
"programs) was 13 percent higher than the odds for those who had not participated. However, only",,,,,,,,
"one study fell into the higher-quality category. Thus, if policymakers want to base decisions on",,,,,,,,
icant difference between program participants and nonparticipants in postrelease employment.,,,,,,,,
"Still, our results suggest a positive association between correctional education and postrelease",,,,,,,,
,"employment. Our findings align with those produced in the Wilson, Gallagher, and MacKenzie",,,,,,,
"(2000)  meta-analysis,  which  also  found  improved  odds  of  employment  among  correctional",,,,,,,,
education participants.,,,,,,,,
When  examining,the  relationship  between  correctional  education  and  postrelease,,,,,,,
"employment, one might expect vocational training programs to be more adept than academic",,,,,,,,
"education programs at imparting labor market skills, awarding industry-recognized creden-",,,,,,,,
"tials,  or  connecting  individuals  with  prospective  employers.  And,  indeed,  when  we  looked",,,,,,,,
,at  the  relationship  between  vocational  training—versus  academic  correctional  education,,,,,,,
"programs—and postrelease employment, we found that individuals who participated in voca-",,,,,,,,
tional training programs had odds of obtaining postrelease employment that were 28 percent higher,,,,,,,,
"than individuals who had not participated. In comparison, individuals who participated in aca-",,,,,,,,
"demic programs (combining ABE, high school/GED, and postsecondary education programs)",,,,,,,,
had only 8 percent higher odds of obtaining postrelease employment than those individuals,,,,,,,,
who had not participated in academic programs. Although the results suggest that vocational,,,,,,,,
training programs have a greater effect than academic programs on one’s odds of obtaining,,,,,,,,
"ratios for the two types of programs, because the number of vocational training studies was",,,,,,,,
relatively small.,,,,,,,,
Relationship Between Computer-Assisted Instruction and Academic Performance,,,,,,,,
We also examined the relationship between computer-assisted instruction and academic per-,,,,,,,,
"formance. In this case, the outcomes of interest were standardized test scores in mathematics",,,,,,,,
or reading. We reviewed four studies that compared the achievement test scores of inmates,,,,,,,,
receiving computer-assisted instruction with the achievement test scores of inmates receiving,,,,,,,,
"face-to-face instruction. In two of the studies, students in both the treatment and comparison",,,,,,,,
"groups also received additional, traditional classroom instruction beyond the portion of their",,,,,,,,
instructional time that was computer-assisted. We estimated that the overall effect of computer-,,,,,,,,
"learning. In other words, on average across the studies, students exposed to computer-assisted",,,,,,,,
instruction relative to traditional instruction learned very slightly more in reading in the same,,,,,,,,
"amount of instructional time and substantially more in mathematics. However, there was no",,,,,,,,
"statistically significant difference in test scores between the different methods of instruction,",,,,,,,,
"and given that the confidence intervals included zero for both reading and mathematics, we",,,,,,,,
could not rule out the possibility that the effects estimated were due to chance alone. Because,,,,,,,,
"computer-assisted instruction can be self-paced and supervised by a tutor or an instructor, it is",,,,,,,,
"potentially less costly to administer. It is worth noting that, since the publication of these four",,,,,,,,
"studies, the capability and utility of instructional technology has progressed substantially (U.S.",,,,,,,,
"Department of Education, 2010), which suggests that the effects of the newer technologies may",,,,,,,,
potentially outstrip those found in the studies examined here.,,,,,,,,
xviii    Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
Comparison of the Costs of Correctional Education Programs and Reincarceration Costs,,,,,,,,
"State policymakers, corrections officials, and correctional education administrators are asking",,,,,,,,
a key question: How cost-effective is correctional education? Our cost analysis suggests that,,,,,,,,
correctional education programs are cost-effective. Focusing only on the direct costs of correc-,,,,,,,,
"tional education programs and of incarceration itself, and using a three-year reincarceration",,,,,,,,
"rate for a hypothetical pool of 100 inmates, we estimated that the three-year reincarceration",,,,,,,,
costs for those who did not receive correctional education would be between $2.94 million and,,,,,,,,
"$3.25 million. In comparison, for those who did receive correctional education, the three-year",,,,,,,,
reincarceration costs would be between $2.07 million and $2.28 million. This means that rein-,,,,,,,,
carceration costs are $0.87 million to $0.97 million less for those who receive correctional edu-,,,,,,,,
"cation. In comparison, our estimates indicate that the costs of providing education to inmates",,,,,,,,
"would range from $140,000 to $174,400 for the pool of 100 inmates. This translates into a",,,,,,,,
"per-inmate cost of correctional education ranging from $1,400 to $1,744, suggesting that pro-",,,,,,,,
viding correctional education is cost-effective compared with the cost of reincarceration. It is,,,,,,,,
"worth noting that this estimate takes into account only the direct costs to the system, but it",,,,,,,,
does not consider such other costs as the financial and emotional costs to victims of crime or to,,,,,,,,
"the criminal justice system as a whole. Hence, it is a conservative estimate of the broader effect",,,,,,,,
that correctional education can potentially yield.,,,,,,,,
"To  further  help  interpret  the  cost  savings,  we  also  calculated  the  break-even  point—",,,,,,,,
defined as the risk difference in the reincarceration rate required for the cost of correctional,,,,,,,,
education to be equal to the cost of incarceration. For a correctional education program to be,,,,,,,,
"cost-effective, we estimated that a program would need to reduce the three-year reincarcera-",,,,,,,,
"tion rate by between 1.9 and 2.6 percentage points to break even. In fact, as noted, our meta-",,,,,,,,
analytic findings show that participation in correctional education programs is associated with,,,,,,,,
prison.,,,,,,,,
Conclusions and Recommendations,,,,,,,,
Our  meta-analytic  findings  provide  further  support  that  receiving  correctional  education,,,,,,,,
while incarcerated reduces an individual’s risk of recidivating after release from prison. Our,,,,,,,,
findings were stable even when we limited our analyses to those studies with more rigorous,,,,,,,,
"research designs. We found a notable effect across all levels of education, from adult basic edu-",,,,,,,,
"cation and GED programs to postsecondary and vocational education programs. Further, our",,,,,,,,
cost analysis suggests that correctional education programs can be cost-effective. As noted by,,,,,,,,
"other researchers interested in estimating the effect of correctional education (e.g., MacKenzie,",,,,,,,,
"2008; Gaes, 2008), we, too, found a number of methodological weaknesses in the current body",,,,,,,,
of research that substantially limit one’s ability to inform the direction of policy and the design,,,,,,,,
"of effective programs. Thus, a number of questions of interest to educators and policymakers",,,,,,,,
"remain that the current literature does not permit us to answer, such as understanding what",,,,,,,,
"is inside the “black box” in terms of what program elements, for example, are associated with",,,,,,,,
effective programs.,,,,,,,,
"In  addition,  much  is  changing  in  the  field  of  correctional  education.  The  2008  reces-",,,,,,,,
sion affected correctional education (and other rehabilitative) programs in a number of states,,,,,,,,
"and led to some dramatic changes in the number of programs offered, the sizes of classes, the",,,,,,,,
Summary    xix,,,,,,,,
"modes of delivery, and the number of inmates who participate in these programs. A reduced",,,,,,,,
funding environment will likely be true for many correctional education programs for the near,,,,,,,,
"future, and questions about the return on investment of these programs will likely continue to",,,,,,,,
be a topic in state-level budget discussions.,,,,,,,,
"Going forward, there is a need to undertake studies that “drill down” to get inside the",,,,,,,,
black box and identify the characteristics of effective programs in terms of such variables as,,,,,,,,
"curriculum, dosage, and quality. To inform policy and funding decisions at the state and fed-",,,,,,,,
"eral levels, policymakers need additional information and a better understanding of how these",,,,,,,,
"programs work (or do not work). In addition, we need to continue to build the evidence base in",,,,,,,,
this area. We provide recommendations for doing so in four critical areas: (1) applying stronger,,,,,,,,
"research designs, (2) measuring program dosage, (3) identifying program characteristics, and",,,,,,,,
(4) examining more proximal indicators of program efficacy.,,,,,,,,
One  option  is  for  state  and  federal  policymakers  and  foundations  to  invest  in  well-,,,,,,,,
"designed evaluations of correctional education programs to inform such policy questions. Also,",,,,,,,,
researchers and program evaluators need to strive to implement rigorous research designs to,,,,,,,,
examine questions related to potential bias and program dosage and to measure both proximal,,,,,,,,
and distal outcomes. Funding grants and guidelines can help further the field by requiring the,,,,,,,,
use of more rigorous research designs. Such funding would also enable correctional educators,,,,,,,,
help in further developing the evidence base in this field to inform policy and programmatic,,,,,,,,
decisionmaking.,,,,,,,,

"U.S. households. Individuals were measured on three different literacy scales: prose, document,",,,,,,,,
"and quantitative.1 On average, inmates had lower scores on all three scales than the general",,,,,,,,
"U.S. population (Greenberg, Dunleavy, and Kutner 2007). A higher percentage of the prison",,,,,,,,
population had average scores that fell within the basic level2 for all three measures of literacy,,,,,,,,
"compared with the household population. For example, 40 percent of the prison population",,,,,,,,
was at the basic level for prose literacy compared with 29 percent of the household population;,,,,,,,,

"significant (Greenberg, Dunleavy, and Kutner, 2007).",,,,,,,,
"In addition to lower levels of educational attainment, the lack of vocational skills and",,,,,,,,
"of  a  steady  history  of  employment  (Petersilia,  2003;  Western,  Kling,  and  Weiman,  2001)",,,,,,,,
"also represents a significant challenge for individuals returning to local communities (Travis,",,,,,,,,
"Solomon, and Waul, 2001). Incarceration affects employment and earnings in a number of",,,,,,,,
effects of incarceration on the earnings and employment in a sample of poor fathers found,,,,,,,,
that the employment rates of formerly incarcerated men were about 6 percentage points lower,,,,,,,,
"than those for a similar group of men who had not been incarcerated (Gellar, Garfinkel, and",,,,,,,,
"Western, 2006). Additionally, incarceration was also associated with a 14–26 percent decline",,,,,,,,
in hourly wages. Given the high incarceration rates in the United States and the fact that many,,,,,,,,
"offenders cycle in and out of prison, Raphael (2007–08) noted that the dynamics of prison",,,,,,,,
entry and reentry inhibited the accumulation of meaningful sustained employment experience,,,,,,,,
in this population.,,,,,,,,
"postrelease employment (Pager, 2003). Holzer, Raphael, and Stoll (2003) conducted a series",,,,,,,,
of surveys of employers in four major U.S. cities and found that employers were much more,,,,,,,,
averse to hiring ex-offenders than in hiring any other disadvantaged group. Willingness to hire,,,,,,,,
ex-offenders was greater for jobs in construction or manufacturing than for those in the retail,,,,,,,,
trade and service sectors; employers’ reluctance was greatest for violent offenders than for non-,,,,,,,,
violent drug offenders.,,,,,,,,
Pager  (2003)  conducted  an  audit  survey  of  approximately  200  employers  in  Milwau-,,,,,,,,
kee and generated four groups of male job applicants who were very similar in educational,,,,,,,,
and work experience credentials but differed by whether they were offenders or nonoffenders,,,,,,,,
and by race. Pager found that black offenders received less than one-seventh the number of,,,,,,,,

offenders generated fewer than half as many offers as white nonoffenders—14 percent versus,,,,,,,,
"34 percent, respectively. In terms of differences by racial group, 17 percent of white offenders",,,,,,,,
"received a job offer compared with only 5 percent of black offenders. Another barrier is that, in",,,,,,,,
"many states, employers can be held liable for the criminal actions of their employees (Raphael,",,,,,,,,
"2007–08). Taken together, lower overall educational attainment, lower levels of literacy, and",,,,,,,,
difficulty securing employment upon release underscores the importance of educational pro-,,,,,,,,
gramming for this population.,,,,,,,,
Overview of U.S. Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
"programming (Stephan, 2008, Appendix Table 18). Data from the BJS 2005 Census of State",,,,,,,,
"offered literacy or 1st–4th grade education programs, 64 percent offered 5th–8th grade educa-",,,,,,,,
"tion programs, 76 percent offered secondary or GED, 50 percent offered vocational training,",,,,,,,,
"33 percent offered special education, and 33 percent offered college courses (Stephan, 2008).",,,,,,,,
"Although  most  state  prison  facilities  offer  some  form  of  education,  participation  rates",,,,,,,,
"vary and, in fact, have declined somewhat over time. For example, between 1997 and 2004,",,,,,,,,
"participation rates in ABE, GED, postsecondary, and vocational training programs all showed",,,,,,,,
"a modest decline (Crayton and Neusteter, 2008). In 2004, 52 percent of state prison inmates",,,,,,,,
reported having participated in a correctional education program since admission to a correc-,,,,,,,,
"tional facility (Harlow, 2003). Only 27 percent of state prison inmates reported having partici-",,,,,,,,
pated in vocational training programs; 19 percent reported having participated in secondary,,,,,,,,
"education programs (i.e., high school/GED); 2 percent in adult basic education; and 7 percent",,,,,,,,
"in adult postsecondary education programs (Crayton and Neusteter, 2008).",,,,,,,,
Reasons for the low participation rates may include lack of programs or lack of aware-,,,,,,,,
"ness of program opportunities, reduced funding for correctional education programs because",,,,,,,,
"of state budget constraints, or competing demands (e.g., when participation is discretionary,",,,,,,,,
an individual might elect to participate in an employment program rather than an education,,,,,,,,
"program) (Crayton and Neusteter, 2008; Tolbert, 2012). In addition, states differ as to whether",,,,,,,,
participation in correctional education programs for incarcerated adults is mandatory or vol-,,,,,,,,
untary.  A  survey  of  state  correctional  education  programs  in  2002  conducted  by  McGlone,,,,,,,,
found that 22 of the 50 states had adopted legislation or implemented policy requiring man-,,,,,,,,
"achieving a GED as the requirement for program completion (McGlone, 2002).",,,,,,,,
The administration and delivery of correctional education also differs from state to state.,,,,,,,,
"For example, different entities—state departments of corrections, education, public safety, or",,,,,,,,
labor—may be responsible for administering and financing correctional education programs,,,,,,,,
"for their prison systems. Some states have their own correctional school district, such as Texas,",,,,,,,,
"Florida, and Ohio. Some states may contract with community colleges to provide GED prepa-",,,,,,,,
"ration, postsecondary education, or vocational training programs; other states may contract",,,,,,,,
"out only some of their programs. In addition, privately operated corrections firms also have",,,,,,,,
"responsibility for providing correctional education to adult prisoners. In 2011, approximately",,,,,,,,
8 percent of the U.S. state prison population was housed in privately operated facilities (Glaze,,,,,,,,
"and Parks, 2012).",,,,,,,,
Introduction    5,,,,,,,,
Previous Meta-Analyses of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
"into society is the key goal of our study and meta-analysis. As a backdrop to our study, we first",,,,,,,,
synthesize  findings  from  previous  meta-analyses  of  correctional  education  programs  in  the,,,,,,,,
"United States. In keeping with our study goals, we discuss only meta-analyses that have an",,,,,,,,
explicit focus on education programs administered primarily to adult offenders in correctional,,,,,,,,
"facilities. According to our review, there have been three major published meta-analyses that",,,,,,,,
"meet these criteria: Wilson, Gallagher, and MacKenzie (2000); MacKenzie (2006); and Aos,",,,,,,,,
"Miller, and Drake (2006).3 These studies differ in their parameters, methods, and conclusions.",,,,,,,,
"We review the findings from each of these meta-analyses in turn, focusing first on a landmark",,,,,,,,
"systematic review of correctional education programs conducted by Lipton, Martinson, and",,,,,,,,
Wilks (1975) that set the stage for the current policy discourse and research direction in the,,,,,,,,
field.4,,,,,,,,
"Lipton, Martinson, and Wilks (1975)",,,,,,,,
"In 1975, Douglas Lipton, Robert Martinson, and Judith Wilks published a systematic review",,,,,,,,
of 231 studies of prisoner rehabilitation programs spanning the years 1945 to 1967—a review,,,,,,,,
that provided the first major stocktaking of the potential efficacy of correctional education.,,,,,,,,
"Commissioned by the New York State Governor’s Special Committee on Criminal Offenders,",,,,,,,,
this seminal review was developed in response to the lack of evidence about whether the array,,,,,,,,
of programs and reform efforts in place at the time were successfully preparing prisoners for,,,,,,,,
"reintegration into their communities. For studies to be included in their review, Lipton and his",,,,,,,,
"colleagues required that studies use a treatment and comparison group design, with the treat-",,,,,,,,
ment group composed of program participants and the comparison group composed of non-,,,,,,,,
"participants. To determine whether different types of programs were working, they tallied the",,,,,,,,
"findings from individual studies—those that favored the treatment group, those that favored",,,,,,,,
"the comparison group, and those with no discernible difference between the treatment and",,,,,,,,
comparison group—and drew conclusions based on the frequency of statistically significant,,,,,,,,
relationships.,,,,,,,,
"Within their sample of 231 programs, Lipton and his team identified a subset of “skill-",,,,,,,,
"development programs,” which consisted of academic and/or vocational training. They sum-",,,,,,,,
marized comparisons of program participants and nonparticipants in studies that used recidi-,,,,,,,,
"vism and employment as outcomes. Across eight studies that assessed recidivism, three showed",,,,,,,,
"significantly lower rates of recidivism among program participants, and one showed signifi-",,,,,,,,
cantly higher rates of recidivism among program participants. The other four studies showed,,,,,,,,
"States. However, a handful of international studies are also included.",,,,,,,,
4,,,,,,,,
"Wilson, Gallagher, and MacKenzie (2000); MacKenzie (2006); and Aos, Miller, and Drake (2006).",,,,,,,,
6    Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
no differences between the treatment and comparison groups. In two studies that examined,,,,,,,,
"employment as an outcome, offenders who participated in vocational training programs fared",,,,,,,,
"worse than nonparticipants after being released. Overall, their review found no conclusive evi-",,,,,,,,
"dence that correctional education was beneficial and found that, in some cases, it might even",,,,,,,,
be harmful.,,,,,,,,
"Lipton’s systematic review is notable, in part, because it set the tone for future research",,,,,,,,
"Martinson, the study’s second author, published a preview of the findings in a commentary",,,,,,,,
"“What Works?—Questions and Answers About Prison Reform” in The Public Interest. In it,",,,,,,,,
Martinson wrote: “it can safely be said that they [the studies included in their review] provide,,,,,,,,
us with no clear evidence that education or skill development programs have been success-,,,,,,,,
ful” (p. 27). Martinson’s summation cast doubt on the utility of educational programming,,,,,,,,
within the broader system of corrections and generated the provocative conclusion that “noth-,,,,,,,,
ing works” in prisoner rehabilitation. Although the “nothing works” tagline was never used in,,,,,,,,
"the full empirical report, the tagline from Martinson’s commentary became synonymous with",,,,,,,,
"the Lipton, Martinson, and Wilks review; as a result, federal- and state-sponsored initiatives to",,,,,,,,
address the needs of prisoners were effectively put on the defensive and in some cases curtailed.,,,,,,,,
"Wilson, Gallagher, and MacKenzie (2000)",,,,,,,,
"The empirical documentation of the Lipton study, along with Martinson’s critique, galvanized",,,,,,,,
"methods of educating prisoners. However, it was not until 25 years later, in 2000, that the",,,,,,,,
efficacy of correctional education was revisited through a formal meta-analysis conducted by,,,,,,,,
"David Wilson, Catherine Gallagher, and Doris MacKenzie (2000) at the University of Mary-",,,,,,,,
land. Their meta-analysis included 33 studies of correctional education programs administered,,,,,,,,
to adults published after 1975—a time period that broadly covered the time since the Lipton,,,,,,,,
study was released.,,,,,,,,
"The Wilson, Gallagher, and MacKenzie study attempted to improve on two limitations",,,,,,,,
of Lipton’s work: (1) The Lipton study did not address the magnitude of differences in out-,,,,,,,,
"comes between treatment and comparison groups, and (2) the Lipton study did not explicitly",,,,,,,,
account for variation in the quality of the research designs across studies. With respect to the,,,,,,,,
"former limitation, Lipton’s review simply summed up the number of studies that yielded sta-",,,,,,,,
tistically significant differences between the treatment and comparison groups and based the,,,,,,,,
study’s conclusions on the preponderance of effects in one direction or the other; this approach,,,,,,,,
"is sometimes referred to as a “vote counting” approach, in which each study gets a vote in the",,,,,,,,
"“significant” or the “not significant” column, and the votes are counted (Field, 2005). Unfor-",,,,,,,,
"tunately, this approach essentially obscures the magnitude of the effects across studies. In other",,,,,,,,
"words, a large difference favoring the treatment group “counts the same” as a small difference",,,,,,,,
favoring the comparison group.,,,,,,,,
"With  respect  to  the  latter  limitation,  Lipton’s  review  discussed  differences  in  method-",,,,,,,,
"ological quality, highlighting (where appropriate) studies with carefully or poorly selected com-",,,,,,,,
"parison groups. However, this variation in research design did not factor into how they tallied",,,,,,,,
statistically significant program effects.,,,,,,,,
"To address these limitations, Wilson and his team used formal meta-analytic techniques,",,,,,,,,
which average findings of multiple studies into a single parameter of program or “treatment,,,,,,,,

at the University of Maryland developed specifically for systematic reviews of correctional pro-,,,,,,,,
"grams (Sherman et al., 1997). This scale, referred to as the Maryland Scientific Methods Scale",,,,,,,,
"(the Maryland SMS), classifies studies as either experimental or quasi-experimental. Following",,,,,,,,
"Shadish, Cook, and Campbell (2002), experimental studies are defined as those that randomly",,,,,,,,
"assign participants to treatment and control-group status, whereas quasi-experimental studies",,,,,,,,
"are those that employ both a treatment and comparison group, but in which group member-",,,,,,,,
ship is not randomly assigned.,,,,,,,,
"Among the quasi-experimental studies, the Maryland SMS further classifies them accord-",,,,,,,,
ing to the quality of statistical controls they employ. Studies from most to least rigorous are,,,,,,,,
classified as follows: Level 5 indicates a well-executed randomized controlled trial (or RCT);,,,,,,,,
Level  4  indicates  a  quasi-experimental  design  with  very  similar  treatment  and  comparison,,,,,,,,
groups;  Level  3  indicates  a  quasi-experimental  design  with  somewhat  dissimilar  treatment,,,,,,,,
experimental  design  with  somewhat  dissimilar  treatment  and  comparison  groups  and  with,,,,,,,,
limited and/or no controls for differences; and Level 1 indicates a study with no separate com-,,,,,,,,
rating and then used the scale as a control variable to determine whether their findings were,,,,,,,,
dependent on the research designs used by the studies’ authors.,,,,,,,,
"Whereas  the  Lipton  study  documented  mostly  mixed  results,  the  Wilson  study  found",,,,,,,,
"that correctional programs were beneficial, by and large. In their meta-analysis, they demon-",,,,,,,,
"strated that participation in academic programs—including ABE, GED, and postsecondary",,,,,,,,
education programs—was associated with an average reduction in recidivism of about 11 per-,,,,,,,,
centage points. This finding was robust when controlling for ratings on the Maryland SMS.,,,,,,,,
"Academic program participation was also associated with a greater likelihood of employment,",,,,,,,,
although they did not quantify the relationship in terms of a percentage increase/decrease in,,,,,,,,
the same way they did for recidivism. Vocational training program participation did not yield a,,,,,,,,
consistent relationship with recidivism but was associated with increased odds of employment.,,,,,,,,
"Wilson and his team’s findings, based on more recent programs and more rigorous methods of",,,,,,,,
"analysis, questioned the Martinson study’s claim that “nothing works.”6",,,,,,,,
MacKenzie (2006),,,,,,,,
"A few years later in 2006, Doris MacKenzie, a co-author of the Wilson study, updated their",,,,,,,,
"original meta-analysis. In this update, she included a handful of newer studies and limited",,,,,,,,
"her sample to only those studies published after 1980. Additionally, she limited her sample of",,,,,,,,
"studies to only those receiving a Level 3 or higher rating on the Maryland SMS, thereby elimi-",,,,,,,,
"weakest study designs. In her re-analysis, she again found that academic program participation",,,,,,,,
appeared beneficial: The odds of not recidivating were 16 percent higher among academic pro-,,,,,,,,

"Aos, Miller, and Drake (2006)",,,,,,,,
"Also in 2006, Steve Aos, Marna Miller, and Elizabeth Drake of the Washington State Institute",,,,,,,,
for Public Policy conducted a meta-analysis of 571 offender rehabilitation programs for adults,,,,,,,,
"sample to studies conducted from 1970 onward and, like MacKenzie’s meta-analysis published",,,,,,,,

tion is associated with postrelease success in the labor market remains unclear.,,,,,,,,
Study’s Objective and Scope,,,,,,,,
"As with the meta-analyses described above, our study aims to understand whether the body",,,,,,,,
can help successfully prepare offenders for community reintegration upon release. Following,,,,,,,,
"the lead of Wilson and colleagues, MacKenzie, and Aos and colleagues, we use meta-analytic",,,,,,,,
techniques to synthesize the effects of correctional education programs administered to adults,,,,,,,,
"across multiple studies. In doing so, our goal is to build on the contributions of their work,",,,,,,,,
"while extending them in a number of key ways, which we describe below.",,,,,,,,
"First, our study examines multiple outcomes: recidivism, employment, and achievement",,,,,,,,
"test scores. As with previous syntheses, our focus is largely on recidivism, because it is the out-",,,,,,,,
"come most often used in the literature, and the ability to avoid recidivism is arguably an impor-",,,,,,,,
"tant marker of successful rehabilitation. However, we also examine whether participating in a",,,,,,,,
correctional education program is associated with an increase in labor force participation and,,,,,,,,
whether participating in a correctional education program with a computer-assisted instruc-,,,,,,,,
tional component is associated with gains in achievement test scores.,,,,,,,,
Acquiring steady employment postrelease has been shown to be an important factor in,,,,,,,,
"preventing  recidivism  among  ex-offenders  (Laub  and  Sampson,  2003;  Uggen,  2000),  and",,,,,,,,
"among the civilian population, improving the acquisition of academic skills and concepts is",,,,,,,,
Introduction    9,,,,,,,,
"vital in securing employment (Klerman and Karoly, 1994). In terms of life-course or devel-",,,,,,,,
"opmental criminology, an emergent body of research has shown that desistance from deviant",,,,,,,,
behavior in adulthood is largely contingent on the opportunity for individuals to acquire new,,,,,,,,
roles and responsibilities in their immediate social nexus. This life-course approach contends,,,,,,,,
"that the acquisition of stable, gainful employment—a productive, socially normative role—",,,,,,,,
"redirects behavior and energy toward one’s family and community and, consequently, away",,,,,,,,
"from crime (Laub and Sampson, 2003; Uggen, 2000). We examine employment outcomes,",,,,,,,,
because many of the programs we reviewed were explicitly geared toward providing inmates,,,,,,,,
"prison. With respect to skill development, the most proximal measures of program efficacy are",,,,,,,,
indicators of the inmates’ learning that can be attributed directly to the courses taken while,,,,,,,,
"incarcerated.  Thus,  our  assessment  of  three  distinctive  outcomes—recidivism,  employment,",,,,,,,,
and academic achievement—helps to elucidate potential mechanisms through which program,,,,,,,,
participation may help improve the postrelease prospects of those formerly incarcerated.,,,,,,,,
Another way our study differs from the previous meta-analyses is in how we deal with,,,,,,,,
the underlying studies. One major limitation of the extant research on correctional education,,,,,,,,
"is the dearth of studies that used experimental designs, making it difficult to establish a causal",,,,,,,,
"experimental designs are susceptible to selection bias, whereby inmates who elect to participate",,,,,,,,
in educational programs may differ in unmeasured ways from inmates who elect not to par-,,,,,,,,
"ticipate in those programs. For instance, they may be more motivated, have a stronger internal",,,,,,,,
"locus of control, or be more proactive about planning for their postrelease futures. Therefore,",,,,,,,,
differences detected between program participants and nonparticipants in meta-analyses with,,,,,,,,
a large number of nonexperimental studies may reflect pretreatment attributes of the inmates,,,,,,,,
who participated in the studies and not the true effects of the programs themselves. To deal,,,,,,,,
"rating in their meta-analysis, and the MacKenzie and Aos analyses reviewed only studies that",,,,,,,,
"earned at least a Level 3 rating on the Maryland SMS. In our analysis, we pay special attention",,,,,,,,
"to those studies receiving a higher (Level 4 or Level 5) rating. As a result, our study provides",,,,,,,,
the most scientifically defensible evidence of program efficacy to date.,,,,,,,,
A defining feature of our review is that it is the most comprehensive and most recent to,,,,,,,,
"date, including a total of 58 studies of correctional educational programs in the United States",,,,,,,,
"(compared with 33 studies reviewed by Wilson and colleagues, 22 reviewed by MacKenzie,",,,,,,,,
and 21 reviewed by Aos and colleagues). Our review also focuses specifically on academic and,,,,,,,,
"training/reentry programs and work placement programs. Before our review, the meta-analysis",,,,,,,,
"with the most current coverage was Aos, Miller, and Drake (2006), which included studies",,,,,,,,
"published through 2005, whereas our meta-analysis  incorporates studies published  through",,,,,,,,
include 12 newer studies published between 2006 and 2011.,,,,,,,,
"Finally, we used a rigorous review process with multiple quality control checks (described",,,,,,,,
in detail in the next chapter) to ensure that the data extracted from each study are accurate,,,,,,,,
"details on the data extraction process used in previous meta-analyses are limited, it appears",,,,,,,,
that most of this work was carried by the researchers themselves and/or a small team of gradu-,,,,,,,,
"ate students. For our study, we assembled an independent scientific review team comprising",,,,,,,,
10    Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
content experts external to RAND who have publication and/or funding track records in the,,,,,,,,
field of correctional education research. Each study included in our meta-analysis was assessed,,,,,,,,
"independently by two members of the scientific review team, with each independent evalua-",,,,,,,,
"tion reviewed, edited, and finalized by both a graduate student and a project team member.",,,,,,,,
Given the way we constructed the data extraction and review teams and the multiple stages of,,,,,,,,
"extraction and review, we feel that the data used to construct our meta-analysis are the most",,,,,,,,
complete in terms of content and quality.,,,,,,,,
Study’s Limitations,,,,,,,,
"As with all studies, there are some study limitations the reader should keep in mind. The major-",,,,,,,,
ity of the studies we reviewed focused on the outcome measures of recidivism and employ-,,,,,,,,
ment; a more limited set also examined the relationship between correctional education and,,,,,,,,
academic performance. There are also more proximal outcomes of interest in correctional edu-,,,,,,,,
"cation, such as program completion, behavior while incarcerated, and progress on individual",,,,,,,,
because of the limited number of studies examining these indicators.,,,,,,,,
"The correctional education literature is varied, including studies published in academic",,,,,,,,
journals and in other arenas—what often is referred to as the “grey literature.” As detailed in,,,,,,,,
"Chapter Two, a strength of our study is the literature review process in which we identified",,,,,,,,
studies done on correctional education programs that were published in the peer-reviewed and,,,,,,,,
"grey literature by searching online databases, research institutions and colleges’ websites, and",,,,,,,,
"dissertation abstracts, and by reaching out to departments of corrections and research units.",,,,,,,,
"Although our search of the grey literature was extensive, it was not exhaustive, in that we were",,,,,,,,
"unable to contact every department of corrections, for example, to obtain copies of unpub-",,,,,,,,
"lished evaluation reports. Of the grey literature we were able to explore, much of it yielded",,,,,,,,
"descriptive studies, and our search did not yield studies with research designs of high enough",,,,,,,,
"quality to be included in our meta-analysis. That said, to the extent that we missed some high-",,,,,,,,
"quality reports from the grey literature through our search strategy, then this is a potential",,,,,,,,
study limitation.,,,,,,,,
To provide practitioners with evidence on effective program design and implementation,,,,,,,,
"and refinement, we originally sought to identify specific aspects of correctional education pro-",,,,,,,,
"grams that show signs of efficacy, such as the type of program (e.g., ABE, GED, postsecondary)",,,,,,,,
"or the method of delivery used (e.g., whole class instruction, one-on-one instruction). How-",,,,,,,,
"ever, few studies provided sufficient information to allow for complete or consistent coding",,,,,,,,
"across program characteristics. Despite the need for this information in the field, our analyses",,,,,,,,
are exploratory in nature and limited in what we are able to discern in terms of elements of,,,,,,,,
effective programs.,,,,,,,,
"Finally,  our  literature  review  covers  the  time  period  from  January  1,  1980,  through",,,,,,,,
"December 31, 2011. As with any systematic literature review and meta-analysis, one has to",,,,,,,,
define a starting point and a cutoff date for inclusion. Our focus on the past three decades,,,,,,,,
precludes a historic look at how correctional education programs may have evolved in the years,,,,,,,,
"immediately following the publication of the Lipton study. Additionally, we are aware of a few",,,,,,,,
"studies that were just recently published (after our cutoff date of December 31, 2011); these",,,,,,,,
studies were not eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis.,,,,,,,,

Introduction,,,,,,,,
"This chapter describes our literature search, screening, and review procedures; our approaches",,,,,,,,
to rating the rigor of each study; and the meta-analytic model used to pool and to synthesize the,,,,,,,,
"results of these studies. As described in greater detail in this chapter, the meta-analytic results",,,,,,,,
we present are from a comprehensive literature search for published and unpublished studies,,,,,,,,
released between 1980 and 2011 that examined the relationship between correctional educa-,,,,,,,,
tion participation and inmate outcomes. We decided to use 1980 as a starting point to ensure,,,,,,,,
that we captured a large enough sample of studies to conduct a meta-analysis with sufficient,,,,,,,,
statistical power; extending too far back in time risks relying on programs that are outmoded,,,,,,,,
and/or less relevant to the current correctional environment. We focused exclusively on studies,,,,,,,,
published in English of correctional education programs in the United States that included an,,,,,,,,
academic and/or vocational curriculum with a structured instructional component.,,,,,,,,
"Studies  were  subjected  to  two  rounds  of  screening,  each  by  two  independent  screen-",,,,,,,,
"ers, for appropriateness of interventions, outcomes, and research designs. Those that met the",,,,,,,,
screening criteria were reviewed independently and in detail by two Ph.D.-level reviewers. The,,,,,,,,
reviews were then reconciled first by a graduate student and then by a Ph.D.-level member of,,,,,,,,

Comprehensive Literature Search,,,,,,,,
"To identify studies for our meta-analysis, we conducted a comprehensive literature search. As",,,,,,,,
"part of this search, we first scanned the universe of potential published and unpublished docu-",,,,,,,,
ments to compile all available empirical research studies that examine the effect of correctional,,,,,,,,
education programs on participant outcomes. We then reviewed the documents to determine if,,,,,,,,
they met a set of eligibility criteria that would permit their use in a meta-analysis. A flow chart,,,,,,,,
depicting the steps through which documents were acquired and assessed for eligibility in the,,,,,,,,
meta-analysis is shown in Figure 2.1. We provide details on each of these steps below.,,,,,,,,
Document Identification,,,,,,,,
The  literature  search  commenced  with  an  attempt  to  identify  and  to  locate  all  possible,,,,,,,,
sources of empirical analyses of correctional education’s relationship with inmate outcomes.,,,,,,,,
"We  employed  three  methods  to  identify  potential  documents,  carried  out  in  the  following",,,,,,,,

"included in Appendix A.1 This document identification stage produced a list of 1,112 citations",,,,,,,,
for documents that could potentially be eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis.,,,,,,,,
Eligibility Assessment,,,,,,,,
Our expansive search strategy yielded a range of documents that were either not focused on,,,,,,,,
"correctional education or were not primary empirical studies (e.g., newspaper articles, opinion",,,,,,,,
"pieces, literature reviews, workbooks, implementation guides). To eliminate these documents,",,,,,,,,
we trained a team of doctoral students in the Pardee RAND Graduate School (PRGS) on the,,,,,,,,
goals of our review and on how to assess whether the document was a primary empirical study,,,,,,,,
"of a correctional education program.2 To standardize our assessment process, we uploaded the",,,,,,,,
"bibliographic reference information for each document into DistillerSR, a web-based applica-",,,,,,,,
tion designed to facilitate systematic literature reviews. Each reference was assessed indepen-,,,,,,,,
"dently by two doctoral students within DistillerSR, where they had the opportunity to review",,,,,,,,
"the document’s title, source, and abstract. If they disagreed on whether the document was a",,,,,,,,
"primary empirical study related to correctional education, the reference was flagged and a proj-",,,,,,,,
ect team member reconciled the discrepancy. If there was not enough information to make a,,,,,,,,
"firm assessment, the project team member erred on the side of caution and marked the refer-",,,,,,,,
ence as eligible for the next stage of review.,,,,,,,,
the list of references lacking sufficient information to determine if they were primary studies,,,,,,,,
related to correctional education were delivered to RAND’s research library staff to retrieve,,,,,,,,
hard copies of the documents. The documents were then uploaded into DistillerSR. For this,,,,,,,,
document. With access to the entire document in addition to the bibliographic reference infor-,,,,,,,,
"mation, they were able to confirm whether or not it was a primary empirical study of correc-",,,,,,,,
tional education.,,,,,,,,
"Of the original 1,112 documents identified, 845 were not primary empirical studies of",,,,,,,,
correctional education and 267 were primary empirical studies of correctional education. Of,,,,,,,,
"the 267 primary empirical studies, we were unable to locate 16 documents, and an additional",,,,,,,,
22 documents were determined to be duplicates of other studies. This included either exact,,,,,,,,
duplicates or studies by the same author(s) that were published in different venues but with the,,,,,,,,
"same findings and/or analytic samples. In the latter situation, we used the document with the",,,,,,,,
most comprehensive information on the program and the study design. For each of the 229,,,,,,,,
"nonduplicative studies that we were able to obtain, the doctoral students examined its content",,,,,,,,
to determine if it met three criteria necessary for inclusion in our meta-analysis:,,,,,,,,
•	 The study needed to evaluate an eligible intervention.,,,,,,,,
•	 The study needed to measure success of the program using an eligible outcome measure.,,,,,,,,
•	 The study needed to employ an eligible research design.,,,,,,,,
"For our study, we define an eligible intervention as an educational program administered",,,,,,,,
"in a jail or prison in the United States published (or released) between January 1, 1980, and",,,,,,,,
"December 31, 2011. We define an educational program as one that includes an academic and/or",,,,,,,,
"vocational curriculum taught by an instructor, designed to lead to the attainment of a degree,",,,,,,,,
"license, or certification. The program could be part of a larger set of services administered to",,,,,,,,
"inmates or it could be a stand-alone program. However, it needed to have an explicit academic",,,,,,,,
"or vocational curriculum in place with an instructional component. Therefore, prison work",,,,,,,,
programs  and  job  placement  programs  lacking  a  structured  training  component  under  the,,,,,,,,
"supervision of an instructor were deemed ineligible. Additionally, although the program may",,,,,,,,
"include postrelease services, it must be primarily administered while the inmate is held in a",,,,,,,,
correctional setting. Programs administered to parolees were excluded. Instructional programs,,,,,,,,
"that did not explicitly address academic or vocational skills—for instance life skills, drug reha-",,,,,,,,
"bilitation, and anger management programs—were also excluded.",,,,,,,,
The study needed to measure the effectiveness of the program using an eligible outcome,,,,,,,,
"measure, which for our meta-analysis include recidivism, employment, and achievement test",,,,,,,,
"scores. Initially we kept our parameters broad and considered a range of possible outcomes,",,,,,,,,
"such as disciplinary infractions while incarcerated, postrelease educational attainment, wages,",,,,,,,,
"and subjective evaluations of program effectiveness. However, a representative meta-analysis",,,,,,,,
requires  a  moderate  number  of  studies  with  outcomes  measured  in  a  comparable  way.  Few,,,,,,,,
"studies with these other outcomes met this requirement, and so we eventually excluded them",,,,,,,,
from consideration.,,,,,,,,
"For the purposes of our meta-analysis, we consider an eligible research design as one in",,,,,,,,
which there is a treatment group composed of inmates who participated in and/or completed,,,,,,,,
the correctional education program under consideration and a comparison group composed,,,,,,,,
of inmates who did not. Comparison groups that deviated from this definition—such as com-,,,,,,,,
parison groups composed of nonincarcerated participants or comparison groups who received,,,,,,,,
a different correctional education intervention from the one under consideration—were not,,,,,,,,
cal detail on both the treatment and the comparison groups to meet this eligibility criterion.3,,,,,,,,
"As with the initial review of the bibliographic reference information, if the two doctoral",,,,,,,,
students reviewing the full text of the document disagreed on whether the document met any,,,,,,,,
"of these three criteria, the document was flagged and a project team member reconciled the",,,,,,,,
"discrepancy. Of the 229 nonduplicative studies that we were able to obtain, 58 studies had",,,,,,,,
"an eligible intervention, an eligible outcome measure, and an eligible research design—and,",,,,,,,,
"thus, were eligible for inclusion into our meta-analysis. Of these 58 studies, 50 studies used",,,,,,,,
"recidivism as an outcome variable, 18 studies used employment as an outcome variable, and",,,,,,,,
four studies used achievement test scores as an outcome variable. All four of the studies that,,,,,,,,
used achievement test scores as the outcome variable evaluated the effects of computer-assisted,,,,,,,,
"instruction. Therefore, although our analyses of recidivism and employment outcomes look at",,,,,,,,
Study Methodology    17,,,,,,,,
"a broad range of correctional education programs, our analysis of achievement test scores is",,,,,,,,
"solely focused on programs with computer-assisted instruction. Hence, we refer to our analysis",,,,,,,,
of test scores as our computer-assisted instruction meta-analysis. Bibliographic citations for all,,,,,,,,
status with respect to the three eligibility criteria are reported in Appendix E. Those 58 studies,,,,,,,,
"deemed eligible for meta-analysis were then subjected to a formal scientific review, described",,,,,,,,
in detail in the next section.,,,,,,,,
Scientific Review,,,,,,,,
Independent Reviews by the Scientific Review Team,,,,,,,,
"ventions, outcomes, and participants in each study. To undertake these detailed reviews, we",,,,,,,,
departments across the country who possessed not only methodological expertise in quantita-,,,,,,,,
"tive social science research but also substantive expertise in correctional education, criminal",,,,,,,,
"justice, and/or social services for at-risk populations. A list of the scientific review members,",,,,,,,,
"their educational credentials, and their current positions is shown in Appendix B.",,,,,,,,
"To guide extraction of the data from the individual studies, we designed a scientific review",,,,,,,,
protocol. This protocol was developed with close attention to the review procedures used in,,,,,,,,
"the U.S. Department of Education’s What Works Clearinghouse (2011), as well as the proce-",,,,,,,,
"dures used in the University of Maryland’s “Preventing Crime” report (Sherman et al., 1997).",,,,,,,,
"The resulting protocol, which is displayed in Appendix D, included four worksheets. The first",,,,,,,,
"or main worksheet contains 44 questions, most of which are multiple choice. These questions",,,,,,,,
"focus largely on the characteristics of the program being evaluated, as well as on the study’s",,,,,,,,
"setting, design, and publication venue. The scientific review team helped guide the selection of",,,,,,,,
intervention characteristics so that our analysis would be as useful as possible to policymak-,,,,,,,,
ers and practitioners. The outcomes worksheet asks for information about the outcome variables,,,,,,,,
in the study. The baseline characteristics worksheet captures descriptive information about the,,,,,,,,
"study participants. Finally, the reviewer log asks about the reviewers’ overall impressions of the",,,,,,,,
"strengths, weaknesses, and implications of the study.",,,,,,,,
The  scientific  review  process  commenced  with  two  full  days  of  training  for  the  team,,,,,,,,
members on how to use the scientific review protocol to record relevant data from the stud-,,,,,,,,
"ies. Following the training, reviewers independently completed two practice protocols, and we",,,,,,,,
provided the team with detailed feedback about response patterns and guidance to encourage,,,,,,,,
"standardized answers. To further encourage consistency among reviewers, we provided a writ-",,,,,,,,
ten manual that further clarified the intent of each question in the protocol.,,,,,,,,
"After  two  scientific  review  team  members  independently  reviewed  each  eligible  study,",,,,,,,,
"review. A project team member then examined each review, referring back to the material in",,,,,,,,
the original document to reconcile items on which the two independent reviewers provided,,,,,,,,
substantively different responses. Another project team reconciled the outcomes and baseline,,,,,,,,
"characteristics worksheets, in all cases consulting each original study to ensure correct data",,,,,,,,
"extraction. As a final precautionary measure, the dataset of extracted, reconciled outcome and",,,,,,,,

baseline characteristics information was checked twice against the main text of the studies for,,,,,,,,
data recording accuracy.4,,,,,,,,
Defining Treatment and Comparison Groups,,,,,,,,
"As described above, our meta-analysis is founded on the aggregation of studies that include",,,,,,,,
rectional education program and a comparison group consisting of inmates who did not par-,,,,,,,,
ticipate in and/or complete the correctional education program. Most studies compared out-,,,,,,,,
comes between these two mutually exclusive groups to test the hypothesis that exposure to,,,,,,,,
"correctional  education  improved  outcomes.  In  some  cases,  the  study  included  more-refined",,,,,,,,
groups based on treatment dosage and program completion. For example Cronin’s study of,,,,,,,,
GED programs in Missouri (2011) identified four groups of inmates: (1) inmates who came to,,,,,,,,
prison without a GED and did not make any progress; (2) inmates who came to prison with-,,,,,,,,
"out a GED, made progress toward obtaining GED, but did not earn a GED; (3) inmates who",,,,,,,,
"earned their GED in prison, and (4) inmates who came to prison with a GED or more. In",,,,,,,,
"this instance, we constructed our treatment and comparison groups as conservatively as pos-",,,,,,,,
"sible following an intent-to-treat approach. In an intent-to-treat approach, every subject who",,,,,,,,
was assigned to the treatment group is analyzed on the outcome of interest as a member of the,,,,,,,,
"treatment group, regardless of whether they received the full dosage of the treatment through",,,,,,,,
"completion. In accord with this approach, we coded groups 2 and 3 in Cronin (2011) as the",,,,,,,,
"treatment group and group 1 as the comparison group. Thus, our analysis reflects all inmates",,,,,,,,
without any exposure to a GED program (comparison group) to inmates who were exposed to,,,,,,,,
"any amount of correctional education while incarcerated, regardless of whether they completed",,,,,,,,
the program (treatment group).,,,,,,,,
Rating the Quality of the Research Design,,,,,,,,
"The quality of any meta-analysis depends on the quality of studies it includes (LeLorier et al.,",,,,,,,,
"1997; Slavin, 1984). One particular concern in social science research—and by extension, in",,,,,,,,
social science meta-analysis—is that effects attributed to program participation in the original,,,,,,,,
studies may actually be driven by the types of individuals who elect to participate in the pro-,,,,,,,,
gram rather than by the causal effect of the program itself. This problem is typically referred to,,,,,,,,
"as selection bias. To minimize concerns about selection bias, some researchers advocate strict",,,,,,,,
"restrictions on the quality of studies included in the meta-analysis (Slavin, 1984), such as the",,,,,,,,
exclusion of all studies that are not RCTs.,,,,,,,,
"Often considered the gold standard in social science research, RCTs are desirable because",,,,,,,,
the random assignment of research participants to treatment and control groups renders the,,,,,,,,
"two groups identical in expectation at the time of assignment (Shadish, Cook, and Campbell,",,,,,,,,
"attributable to the intervention (Myers and Dynarski, 2003; Shadish, Cook, and Campbell,",,,,,,,,
Study Methodology    19,,,,,,,,
so there is the potential for treatment and comparison groups to differ as a result of random,,,,,,,,
"variation. In addition, RCTs sometimes suffer from attrition after the point of randomization,",,,,,,,,
which can potentially introduce systematic differences between the two groups. Despite these,,,,,,,,
"limitations, RCTs offer a strong defense against selection bias, because the treatment assign-",,,,,,,,
"ment process is, by definition, independent of the characteristics of the participants.",,,,,,,,
"Other rigorous comparison-group designs, such as regression discontinuity designs and",,,,,,,,
"instrumental variables analysis, attempt to minimize selection bias in nonrandomized studies",,,,,,,,
"by capitalizing on arguably random processes, but in doing so, they must satisfy a larger set",,,,,,,,
"of assumptions to nullify the threat of selection bias (Angrist and Pischke, 2009; Murnane",,,,,,,,
"and Willett, 2011; Schochet et al., 2010). Still other designs attempt to mitigate selection bias",,,,,,,,
comparing the treatment group to a non–randomly assigned comparison group that is observ-,,,,,,,,
ably similar. Some studies achieve this through matching or weighting the comparison group,,,,,,,,
so that it is similar to the treatment group on a number of possibly confounding character-,,,,,,,,
"istics. When the number of characteristics to be used in the weighting or matching is large,",,,,,,,,
balance can sometimes be achieved by using these characteristics to estimate the probability,,,,,,,,
"probabilities, or propensity scores (McCaffrey, Ridgeway, and Morral, 2004; Rosenbaum and",,,,,,,,
"Rubin, 1983; Rubin, 1997). Matching or weighting on observed characteristics helps ensure",,,,,,,,
"that the observed characteristics are not responsible for any apparent treatment effects, but it",,,,,,,,
"leaves open the possibility that unmeasured differences may be driving such effects. Moreover,",,,,,,,,
because researchers rarely have comprehensive measures of all the group differences—such as,,,,,,,,
"motivation, perseverance, time orientation, or locus of control—that may drive selection into",,,,,,,,
"the groups and also be associated with outcomes, matching and weighting studies remain vul-",,,,,,,,
nerable to selection bias.,,,,,,,,
"Similarly,  studies  that  use  covariate  adjustment—that  is,  that  statistically  control  for",,,,,,,,
possible confounding characteristics through multivariate regression—are also vulnerable to,,,,,,,,
"biases from unobserved variables. In comparison to matching or weighting studies, those that",,,,,,,,
use regression controls may also be more vulnerable to misspecification of the functional form,,,,,,,,
"curvilinear relationships (Ho et al., 2007). Although some studies have found that matching",,,,,,,,
"and weighting perform little better than covariate adjustment, given the same variables (Cook",,,,,,,,
"et al., 2009), there remains a preference in the field for balanced treatment and comparison",,,,,,,,
groups over reliance on statistical controls to adjust for differences between dissimilar groups,,,,,,,,
"(What Works Clearinghouse, 2011).",,,,,,,,
Given the centrality of selection bias as a threat to causal inference in the literature on,,,,,,,,
"social and educational interventions, we rated the quality of evidence in each reviewed study",,,,,,,,
"based on how well the study’s design mitigated this threat. Specifically, we sought to classify",,,,,,,,
the rigor of the eligible studies using evidence ratings that focused on the warranted strength,,,,,,,,
of the causal inference and could be well-understood by both the criminal justice and educa-,,,,,,,,
tion communities.,,,,,,,,
"As noted in Chapter One, we chose the Maryland Scientific Methods Scale, which was",,,,,,,,
developed for the 1997 Preventing Crime report published by University of Maryland research-,,,,,,,,
treatment and comparison groups; Level 3 is a quasi-experimental design with somewhat dis-,,,,,,,,
20    Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
similar treatment  and  comparison  groups  but reasonable controls  for differences; Level 2 is,,,,,,,,
a quasi-experimental design with substantial baseline differences between the treatment and,,,,,,,,
comparison groups that may not be well controlled for; and Level 1 is a study with no separate,,,,,,,,
"comparison group that does not receive the treatment. As noted in Chapter One, the Wilson,",,,,,,,,
"higher on the Maryland SMS, and the later meta-analyses by MacKenzie (2006) and by Aos",,,,,,,,
and colleagues (2006) included only studies rated Level 3 and higher.,,,,,,,,
For communicating results in a way that would be easily understood by the education,,,,,,,,
"community,  we  also  used  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education’s  What  Works  Clearinghouse",,,,,,,,
rating scheme—herein referred to simply as the WWC rating scheme for ease of expression.,,,,,,,,
"The WWC rating scheme has only three categories: Meets Standards, Meets Standards with",,,,,,,,
"Reservations,  and  Does  Not  Meet  Standards.  A  study  that  Meets  Standards  on  the  WWC",,,,,,,,
"rating must be a randomized, controlled trial with low levels of overall and differential attri-",,,,,,,,
tion or it must use a well-executed regression discontinuity or single-case design. An RCT that,,,,,,,,
exceeds the attrition threshold (described further below) is reviewed as a quasi-experimental,,,,,,,,
design.5 A study Meets Standards with Reservations if it is a quasi-experimental design in which,,,,,,,,
the treatment and comparison groups are observably very similar at the point of analysis. This,,,,,,,,
means that all observed baseline characteristics for the treatment and comparison groups are,,,,,,,,
any differences greater than 0.05 of a standard deviation. A study in which the treatment and,,,,,,,,
comparison groups are not within 0.25 of a standard deviation of each other on all observed,,,,,,,,
baseline characteristics and lack statistical controls for any differences greater than 0.05 of a,,,,,,,,
standard deviation Does Not Meet Standards.,,,,,,,,
Operational Use of the Maryland SMS and WWC Rating Scheme,,,,,,,,
A  useful  feature  of  the  Maryland  SMS  and  WWC  rating  scheme  is  that  their  two  highest,,,,,,,,
"evidence categories correspond very closely. Of the two, however, the WWC rating scheme",,,,,,,,
is more specific than the Maryland SMS about precise cutoffs regarding baseline equivalence,,,,,,,,
and attrition.,,,,,,,,
Baseline equivalence refers to the degree to which the treatment and comparison groups,,,,,,,,
are similar at the beginning of the study in terms of characteristics known to influence the,,,,,,,,
outcome. If a study uses random assignment to assign participants to the treatment and com-,,,,,,,,
"parison groups, then baseline equivalence is assumed by both the Maryland SMS and WWC",,,,,,,,
membership  in  the  treatment  or  comparison  group  at  the  point  of  assignment.  The  groups,,,,,,,,
"differ in expectation only by their assignment status, which is random by design. Of course, as",,,,,,,,
"noted above, differences may result simply by accident, especially when the groups are small.",,,,,,,,
"For this reason and because it improves the precision of the treatment effect estimate, research-",,,,,,,,
ers often adjust for any observed baseline differences even in the case of random assignment.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Study Methodology    21,,,,,,,,
"However, neither the WWC rating scheme nor the Maryland SMS requires adjustment for",,,,,,,,
baseline differences in cases of random assignment.,,,,,,,,
"In studies that do not have random assignment, baseline equivalence is established by",,,,,,,,
demonstrating that the treatment and comparison groups are observably similar on key vari-,,,,,,,,
"ables that may be related to both treatment status and the outcome variable, since baseline dif-",,,,,,,,
"ferences between groups could bias the treatment effect estimates, as noted above. For example,",,,,,,,,
if inmates who enroll in correctional education have lower baseline education levels than those,,,,,,,,
education levels (and associated aptitude or motivation levels) as much as to the effect of the,,,,,,,,
treatment program. Both the Maryland SMS and WWC rating scheme are based largely on,,,,,,,,
"the strength of evidence about baseline equivalence, with randomized designs receiving the",,,,,,,,
highest ratings.,,,,,,,,
Attrition rates refer to the percentage of participants whose outcomes are lost to the study,,,,,,,,
"for any number of reasons, such as inability to collect follow-up data on the inmate, transfer of",,,,,,,,
"the inmate to a different correctional facility, loss of follow-up data, and so forth. Importantly,",,,,,,,,
attrition is not the same as noncompletion of a program or intervention among those whose,,,,,,,,
outcomes are observed. Noncompleters who drop out of an intervention program are viewed,,,,,,,,
group within our intent-to-treat framework.,,,,,,,,
The WWC rating scheme is concerned with two types of attrition: overall attrition and,,,,,,,,
differential attrition. Both may undermine the advantages of random assignment by introduc-,,,,,,,,
ing self-selection into the sample for which outcomes are observed. Overall attrition is simply,,,,,,,,
point difference in the attrition rates of the treatment and comparison groups. Because the,,,,,,,,
"concerns about attrition pertain to disruption of random assignment advantages, we follow the",,,,,,,,
WWC rating scheme in applying attrition calculations only to studies that begin with a ran-,,,,,,,,
domized design. Randomized trials with low overall and differential attrition meet the highest,,,,,,,,
"standards on the WWC rating scheme, and we apply this standard to the Maryland SMS as",,,,,,,,
well to meet its highest category. Studies that do not begin with a randomized design do not,,,,,,,,
"need to meet an attrition threshold, but they are also ineligible for the highest ratings on either",,,,,,,,
the Maryland SMS or the WWC rating scheme. These studies need only establish strong evi-,,,,,,,,
dence of baseline equivalence to meet the second-highest tiers of evidence on both scales.,,,,,,,,
"To summarize, studies with high rates of attrition and/or that lack baseline equivalence",,,,,,,,
may yield biased results. Because the WWC rating scheme offers clear guidelines to establish,,,,,,,,
"specific numeric thresholds for these validity threats, we apply those thresholds to both scales.",,,,,,,,
Our operational definitions of each scale are presented in Table 2.1.,,,,,,,,
Because  the  Maryland  SMS’  and  WWC  rating  scheme’s  evidence  standards  are  quite,,,,,,,,
"similar, we operationalize the strongest evidence categories identically across the two scales. To",,,,,,,,
"receive the highest evidence rating on each scale, a study must meet the liberal standard for low",,,,,,,,
overall and differential attrition to earn a Meets Standards rating on the WWC rating scheme,,,,,,,,
and a Level 5 on the Maryland SMS.6 WWC has not published the precise formula for its,,,,,,,,
"attrition thresholds, so the formulae we used are extrapolated from the attrition macro in the",,,,,,,,

Study Methodology    23,,,,,,,,
"treatment and comparison groups are observably very similar, primarily because of deliberate",,,,,,,,
matching or weighting of the comparison group to the characteristics of the treatment group.,,,,,,,,
The result should be that treatment and comparison group members differ by no more than,,,,,,,,
0.05 standard deviation units on three baseline dimensions that are known to be related to,,,,,,,,
"recidivism outcomes and that are relevant to an educational intervention: namely, age, prior",,,,,,,,
"offenses, and baseline educational level. (This also requires that standard deviations of the base-",,,,,,,,
"line characteristics be reported in the studies.) Moreover, we specify that the recidivism and",,,,,,,,
"lection, since inmates released for longer periods will have more time to recidivate and/or to",,,,,,,,
"find work. They can do this by observing everyone for a certain time period (e.g., one year",,,,,,,,
postrelease) or through survival analysis methods that adjust for duration of release. Because,,,,,,,,
"correctional facilities are typically gender-segregated, gender is an unlikely source of selection",,,,,,,,
"bias in this context. Therefore, matching on or controlling for gender does not affect a study’s",,,,,,,,
evidence rating in our analysis.,,,,,,,,
"It  is  important  to  note  that  in  requiring  baseline  equivalence  on  only  four  variables,",,,,,,,,
"we  depart  slightly  from  the  WWC  guidelines,  which  require  that  all  observed  baseline",,,,,,,,
"characteristics—whether 1 or 50, for example—fall within 0.25 standard deviations of each",,,,,,,,
standard deviation be held constant statistically. The reason for this departure is that very few,,,,,,,,
studies in our sample provided adequate information about the distribution of baseline char-,,,,,,,,
"acteristics for us to run these calculations, but a number of studies described matching proce-",,,,,,,,
dures to ensure close balance of the treatment and comparison groups on particular variables.,,,,,,,,
"Also, we do not require matching on all observable variables, because this penalizes studies that",,,,,,,,
"report larger numbers of variables—with a large enough set of variables, we would expect some",,,,,,,,
"differences by chance alone, and this chance would be greater in smaller studies, even when",,,,,,,,
"the studies were otherwise equivalent. Instead, we set a consistent expectation of matching or",,,,,,,,
achieving strong similarity on the three variables known to be strong predictors of postrelease,,,,,,,,
outcomes and on the time period that the individuals were observed postrelease.,,,,,,,,
Studies below Level 4 on the Maryland SMS are classified as “Does Not Meet Standards”,,,,,,,,
"by the WWC rating scheme, because these categories do not require strong similarity between",,,,,,,,
the treatment and comparison groups. We operationalize a Level 3 study on the Maryland,,,,,,,,
SMS to be one that includes statistical controls for at least one of the aforementioned key base-,,,,,,,,
line differences between groups and/or includes matching or weighting on one or two of these,,,,,,,,
variables.,,,,,,,,
We classify Level 2 studies as those that include nonrandomly assigned treatment and,,,,,,,,
comparison groups but do not include any statistical controls or adjustments for differences,,,,,,,,
"between groups. Finally, we classify Level 1 studies as those that lack a comparison group con-",,,,,,,,
sisting of inmates who did not receive the treatment.8,,,,,,,,
Although we classify all studies included in our meta-analysis on both the WWC rating,,,,,,,,
"scheme and the Maryland SMS, we organize most of our analyses around the Maryland SMS",,,,,,,,
because of its granularity in classifying studies—allowing us to make comparisons at more,,,,,,,,
"refined levels of study design rigor. As Wilson and colleagues (2000) did, we restrict our meta-",,,,,,,,
"analysis to studies rated a Level 2 or higher on the Maryland SMS, effectively limiting it to",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
24    Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
"studies that include a distinct comparison group that did not receive the treatment. However,",,,,,,,,
"we focus particularly on the Level 4 and Level 5 studies, which are the least vulnerable to selec-",,,,,,,,
tion bias. We consider the results from these higher-quality studies to be the most robust for,,,,,,,,
"use and application in the field. However, the inclusion of the lower-quality studies in some",,,,,,,,
specifications ensures that we are also making use of the findings of a broad set of studies of a,,,,,,,,
range of program types and models undertaken during the last 32 years.,,,,,,,,
Description of the Data,,,,,,,,
"meta-analysis. For analytic purposes, however, our unit of analysis is the effect size (k) and",,,,,,,,
not the individual study (n). An effect size is the statistic reported in the study that indicates,,,,,,,,
the magnitude of the difference on the outcome of interest between a treatment group and,,,,,,,,
"a comparison group. Across the 58 studies, we were able to extract a total of 102 effect sizes.",,,,,,,,
"The number of effect sizes exceeds the number of studies, because a study could contain mul-",,,,,,,,
"tiple treatment and comparison groups and thus multiple comparisons. For example, a study",,,,,,,,
making  a  single  comparison  of  recidivism  rates  between  a  treatment  group  receiving  GED,,,,,,,,
coursework  and  a  comparison  group  receiving  no  GED  coursework  would  contribute  only,,,,,,,,
"one effect size to our meta-analysis. However, a study comparing the recidivism rates of two",,,,,,,,
treatment groups—one receiving GED coursework and one receiving vocational certification,,,,,,,,
training—with the recidivism rate of a comparison group receiving no form of correctional,,,,,,,,
education would contribute two effect sizes to our meta-analysis.,,,,,,,,
"Our recidivism analysis is based on 71 effect sizes from 50 studies, our employment anal-",,,,,,,,
sizes from four studies. Table 2.2 shows the distribution of studies and effect sizes according,,,,,,,,
to their rating on the Maryland SMS and the WWC rating scheme.9 The majority of studies,,,,,,,,
are of recidivism and employment and the majority of effect sizes come from Level 2 and Level,,,,,,,,
3 studies on the Maryland SMS and Do Not Meet Standards according to the WWC rating,,,,,,,,
"scheme—suggesting that, on average, the field of correctional education research is limited",,,,,,,,
in its ability to assess whether correctional programs yield a causal effect on recidivism and,,,,,,,,
"employment. Therefore, in our analysis, we focus in where possible on those studies that receive",,,,,,,,
a Level 4 or Level 5 rating.,,,,,,,,
Analytic Approach,,,,,,,,
We  conducted  our  meta-analysis  using  a  random-effects  approach.  Random  effects  meta-,,,,,,,,
analysis is appropriate when effect sizes are heterogeneous. This might occur when the indi-,,,,,,,,
vidual studies are not sampled from the same population; this can be conceptualized as there,,,,,,,,
"being a “super-population” of all potential respondents, which contains an array of subpopula-",,,,,,,,
"tions, and each study randomly samples from one of these subpopulations. In addition, dif-",,,,,,,,

One limitation of systematic reviews is that studies that fail to produce statistically sig-,,,,,,,,

drawers and are not widely distributed). This publication bias may skew the findings in favor,,,,,,,,
of successful programs. We attempted to limit the threat of publication bias by searching an,,,,,,,,
array of sources in the literature to procure official program evaluation reports not published,,,,,,,,
"in journals, working papers, research briefs, theses, and dissertations.",,,,,,,,
"To assess whether our results are contingent on the studies that we were able to procure,",,,,,,,,
we perform two diagnostic tests. Our first diagnostic test assesses whether studies with posi-,,,,,,,,
"tive results have a higher probability of publication—that is, whether we can find evidence of",,,,,,,,
"publication bias. Large studies, which have more power and smaller standard errors, will have",,,,,,,,
"a greater chance than small studies of obtaining a statistically significant result, if the popula-",,,,,,,,
estimate of the smaller studies in our pool of eligible studies should be the same as the aver-,,,,,,,,
age effect size estimate of the larger studies in our pool of eligible studies. If publication bias,,,,,,,,
"is having an effect, then small studies that do not obtain statistically significant results should",,,,,,,,
have a lower chance of being published. This can be depicted visually in a “funnel plot” and,,,,,,,,

A second diagnostic test we perform is a “leave-one-out” analysis. There is a risk that one,,,,,,,,

Introduction,,,,,,,,
This chapter presents the results from our meta-analysis where recidivism is the outcome. We,,,,,,,,
first describe how we defined and measured recidivism across the 50 eligible studies and then,,,,,,,,
pool all 71 effect size estimates from the 50 studies together to provide an aggregate estimate,,,,,,,,
"of the relationship between participation in correctional education and recidivism. Next, we",,,,,,,,
designs. We then use previously published national estimates of recidivism to help interpret the,,,,,,,,
magnitude of this relationship. We also explore whether the relationship between correctional,,,,,,,,
used. We conclude with a straightforward cost analysis that compares the cost of correctional,,,,,,,,
education to the cost of reincarceration.,,,,,,,,
group members. We describe each of these dimensions below in turn.,,,,,,,,
"•	 Definition of recidivism. Recidivism is defined a number of ways, including reoffending,",,,,,,,,
"rearrest, reconviction, reincarceration, technical parole violation, and successful comple-",,,,,,,,
"tion of parole. In our pool of 50 studies that had recidivism outcomes, the majority used",,,,,,,,
reincarceration as the outcome measure (n = 34).,,,,,,,,
•	 Time period. Studies varied in the time period through which they followed the study,,,,,,,,
"participants after release from prison, which represents their time “at risk for recidivism.”",,,,,,,,
Studies  ranged  from  examining  a  cohort  of  former  inmates  in  the  community  for  six,,,,,,,,
months since release from prison to following them for over ten years since release from,,,,,,,,
prison. The most frequently used time periods in the 50 eligible studies were one year,,,,,,,,
(n = 13) and three years (n = 10).,,,,,,,,
28    Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
effect sizes reported two different ways—one based on a percentage comparison between,,,,,,,,
the treatment and comparison group and the other based on a regression coefficient.,,,,,,,,
"When there were multiple outcomes and reporting methods used, we gave preference to",,,,,,,,
"reincarceration (as this represents the modal definition of recidivism), recidivism within one",,,,,,,,
year of release or as close as possible to one year (as this represents the modal time period used,,,,,,,,
"by the authors of the studies), and regression coefficients (as this represents the best attempt by",,,,,,,,
"the authors of the studies to reduce potential sources of bias). When these were unavailable, we",,,,,,,,
"used whatever definition, time period, or statistical metric reported by the author so that we",,,,,,,,
"could be as inclusive as possible. As such, our recidivism measure comprises a range of slightly",,,,,,,,
"different measures, and thus should not be interpreted in terms of the individual measures that",,,,,,,,
"make it up.1 Details on how each of the 50 studies defined and operationalized recidivism, as",,,,,,,,
"well as specific information on the individual programs being studied, the research design used",,,,,,,,
"in the study, the WWC’s and the Maryland SMS’ ratings of the study’s research design, and",,,,,,,,
the rates of recidivism recorded for the treatment and comparison group are shown in Appen-,,,,,,,,
dix F.,,,,,,,,
We transformed all 71 effect size estimates from the 50 studies into 71 odds ratios.2 Recall,,,,,,,,
tain multiple treatment and comparison groups and thus multiple comparisons. For our pur-,,,,,,,,
"poses, the odds ratio is calculated as the odds of recidivating among treatment group members",,,,,,,,
divided by the odds of recidivating among comparison group members. Odds ratios greater,,,,,,,,
"than 1 indicate that the treatment group had a higher rate of recidivism, and odds ratios less",,,,,,,,
than 1 indicate that the comparison group had a higher rate of recidivism. An odds ratio of 1,,,,,,,,
indicates that there is no difference between the treatment group and the comparison group.3,,,,,,,,
These 71 odds ratios form the data points on which the random-effects regression is estimated.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"are robust and apply to a range of postrelease settings, circumstances, and outcomes.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"odds ratio has no straightforward, intuitive interpretation.",,,,,,,,

Recidivism,,,,,,,,
The Overall Relationship Between Correctional Education and Recidivism,,,,,,,,
"To assess the relationship between correctional education and recidivism, we first graphed the",,,,,,,,
odds ratios for each of the 71 effect size estimates in Figure 3.1 using a forest plot. Each row,,,,,,,,
"in the plot corresponds to an effect size, labeled on the left with the corresponding first author",,,,,,,,
of the study and the year of publication. Studies with multiple effect sizes are listed multiple,,,,,,,,
"size estimate for the study, and the “whiskers” extend to the range of 95 percent confidence",,,,,,,,
intervals.4 The size of the box is proportional to the weight that is assigned to that effect size.,,,,,,,,
"Weight is determined by sample size, and in the case of a random effects regression such as this,",,,,,,,,
the weight is determined by the difference between the estimate of the effect in that study and,,,,,,,,
"the overall aggregated effect across studies. A very large study, such as Allen’s (2006) study of",,,,,,,,
"over 16,000 inmates participating in academic programs in 15 states, is highly weighted and is",,,,,,,,
represented with a large box.,,,,,,,,
The box and whiskers for each effect size are plotted in relation to the dashed line down,,,,,,,,
"the center of the graph, which indicates an odds ratio of 1. Effect sizes to the right of this line",,,,,,,,
"indicate that the treatment group had a higher odds of recidivating, and effect sizes to the left",,,,,,,,
of this line indicate that the comparison group had a higher odds of recidivating. If the whis-,,,,,,,,
"kers for the corresponding box do not cross this dashed line, then the study yielded a signifi-",,,,,,,,
cant difference between the treatment and comparison group for that particular effect size at,,,,,,,,
"the conventional level of p < 0.05. Conversely, if the whiskers for the corresponding box cross",,,,,,,,
"this dashed line, then there is no significant difference detected between the treatment and",,,,,,,,
comparison group for that particular effect size at the conventional level of p < 0.05.,,,,,,,,
"As can be seen by the patterning of boxes and whiskers in this figure, the majority of",,,,,,,,
"studies report that the odds of recidivism are lower in the treatment group, with one study",,,,,,,,
"(Gordon and Weldon, 2003) finding substantially lower odds of recidivism among treatment",,,,,,,,
group members. A small number of studies find lower odds of recidivism in the comparison,,,,,,,,
"group, but these do not generally achieve statistical significance, as evidenced by the fact that",,,,,,,,
the corresponding whisker crosses the solid black line. The very last row displays the overall,,,,,,,,
odds ratio for all 50 studies with 71 effect size estimates pooled together. The position of this,,,,,,,,
overall odds ratio is indicated across the rest of the studies by the diamond at the bottom of the,,,,,,,,
"graph. The overall odds ratio is 0.64 (p < 0.05, 95 percent confidence interval = 0.59 to 0.70),",,,,,,,,
indicating that across 32 years of empirical studies on the effects of correctional education with,,,,,,,,
"analyses ranging in methodological quality and rigor, on average, the odds of recidivating among",,,,,,,,
inmates receiving correctional education are 64 percent of the odds of recidivating among inmates,,,,,,,,
not receiving correctional education.,,,,,,,,

"As described above, many studies have limitations in their research design that preclude them",,,,,,,,
from ruling out selection bias as an explanation for the observed differences between the treat-,,,,,,,,

"ment and comparison groups. Therefore, although we find across the full sample of studies that",,,,,,,,
participation in correctional education is associated with a reduction in the odds of recidivism,,,,,,,,
"following release, we also examine whether this pattern is maintained when we restrict our",,,,,,,,
sample to studies with the strongest and most scientifically defensible research designs. To this,,,,,,,,
"end, we recalculated the odds ratio for studies that fall at different levels of the Maryland SMS.",,,,,,,,
We first show the odds ratio for those reaching a Level 5—the highest level of methodological,,,,,,,,
rigor. We then recalculated the odds ratio for studies reaching both Level 4 and Level 5. From,,,,,,,,
"here, we stepwise recalculated the odds ratio to incrementally include each of the lower levels",,,,,,,,
of the Maryland SMS. The odds ratios and their corresponding confidence intervals are shown,,,,,,,,
in Table 3.1. The bottom row in Table 3.1 shows the odds and ratio and confidence interval,,,,,,,,
"for all studies meeting a Maryland SMS Level 2 and above, which includes all 50 studies and",,,,,,,,
71 effect size estimates and represents the overall aggregated odds ratio as originally reported,,,,,,,,
in Figure 3.1.,,,,,,,,
We focus our attention on studies that receive a Level 4 or Level 5 rating on the Mary-,,,,,,,,
"land SMS, as they are the most methodologically rigorous and provide the best estimate of the",,,,,,,,
causal relationship between correctional education and recidivism. Level 5 consists of experi-,,,,,,,,
"mental studies that employ randomized control designs, and those in our systematic review",,,,,,,,
that are eligible for the recidivism meta-analysis include two studies with two corresponding,,,,,,,,
"North Carolina (Lattimore, Witte, and Baker, 1988; 1990). The odds ratio for these two stud-",,,,,,,,
"ies is 0.61 (p < 0.05, 95 percent confidence interval = 0.44 to 0.85), indicating that the odds of",,,,,,,,
recidivating among treatment group members in these experimental studies are 61 percent of,,,,,,,,
the odds of recidivating among comparison group members.,,,,,,,,
"Although Level 5 on the Maryland SMS reflects the most stringent research design, the",,,,,,,,

"When we combine these five Level 4 studies with the two Level 5 studies, our aggregated",,,,,,,,

odds of recidivating among treatment group members in the most-rigorous quasi-experimental,,,,,,,,
studies are 43 percent lower than the odds of recidivating among comparison group members.,,,,,,,,
That we obtain odds ratios that are of similar magnitude when restricting our analysis to the,,,,,,,,
studies with the most rigorous research design suggests that the overall effect observed among,,,,,,,,
our full sample of 50 studies is not driven by lower-level studies that are potentially subject to,,,,,,,,
selection bias.,,,,,,,,
"Despite  the  robustness  of  our  findings  across  levels  of  the  Maryland  SMS,  we  cannot",,,,,,,,
say definitively that the similarity of estimates among the lower-level and higher-level studies,,,,,,,,
"means that the programs in each group are equally effective. For example, it is possible that the",,,,,,,,
estimates for the lower-level studies are inflated by selection bias and that the estimates for the,,,,,,,,
higher-level studies generalize only to particular types of higher-quality programs. Yet a closer,,,,,,,,
examination of these studies shows that programs in the higher-level and lower-level studies,,,,,,,,
are similar on most attributes we recorded.5 This suggests that the programs are not drastically,,,,,,,,
different in the two groups of studies and that the effect estimates in the lower-level studies are,,,,,,,,
relatively unbiased.,,,,,,,,
Interpreting the Relationship Between Correctional Education and Recidivism,,,,,,,,
"Because the odds of an outcome—in our case, recidivating—can be a less-intuitive metric to",,,,,,,,
"grasp, we applied two other metrics to aid in interpretation: the risk difference and the number",,,,,,,,
needed to treat. The risk difference is the absolute reduction in recidivism rates between those,,,,,,,,
who received correctional education and those who did not. The number needed to treat indi-,,,,,,,,
cates the predicted number of inmates who need to receive correctional education to prevent,,,,,,,,
one additional inmate from recidivating. These two metrics require an estimated rate of recidi-,,,,,,,,
vism in the population upon which to calibrate their calculations.6 We used recidivism rates,,,,,,,,
from two studies to translate our odds ratio into a risk difference and number needed to treat:,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
lower-level studies reflect the effects of different kinds of programs or contexts.,,,,,,,,

rearrest rates and reincarceration rates from Langan and Levin’s (2002) study for the Bureau,,,,,,,,
of Justice Statistics and reincarceration rates from a more recent study conducted by the Pew,,,,,,,,
"Charitable Trusts (Pew Center on the States, 2011). We base our calculations on our odds ratio",,,,,,,,
"for those studies meeting a Level 4 or Level 5 rating on the Maryland SMS, as these represent",,,,,,,,
our best estimate of the causal effect of correctional education on recidivism using an array of,,,,,,,,
programs. We present these additional interpretative metrics in Table 3.2.,,,,,,,,
Recidivism  rates  from  the  aforementioned  published  studies,indicate  that  between,,,,,,,
43.3 percent and 51.8 percent of former prisoners were reincarcerated within three years of,,,,,,,,
"release, and two-thirds were rearrested within three years of release. If we apply the recidivism",,,,,,,,
"rates estimated by Langan and Levin (2002) for the Bureau of Justice Statistics, we find that",,,,,,,,
correctional education would be expected to reduce three year rearrest and reincarceration rates by,,,,,,,,
"13.2 and 13.8 percentage points, respectively. According to these estimates, eight inmates would",,,,,,,,
need to receive correctional education to prevent one additional inmate from being rearrested,,,,,,,,
"within three years of release, and seven inmates would need to receive correctional education",,,,,,,,
to prevent one additional inmate from returning to prison within three years. The magnitude,,,,,,,,
of these effects is similar when considering more recent national level recidivism estimates by,,,,,,,,
"the Pew Charitable Trusts (Pew Center on the States, 2011): Correctional education would be",,,,,,,,
expected to reduce three-year reincarceration rates by 12.9 percentage points and eight inmates,,,,,,,,
would need to receive correctional education to prevent one additional inmate from returning,,,,,,,,
to prison within three years.,,,,,,,,

A core focus of policymakers and practitioners in the field of correctional education is,,,,,,,,
certain characteristics of programs were more or less associated with reductions in recidivism.,,,,,,,,
When abstracting information on the individual programs into the review protocol (shown,,,,,,,,
"in Appendix D), the scientific review team members identified the type of program examined",,,,,,,,
"(e.g., GED preparation, vocational training) and the instructional delivery method used (e.g.,",,,,,,,,
"whole class instruction, one-on-one class instruction).7 We use this information to recalculate",,,,,,,,
our odds ratios for programs with these different characteristics. Because of the small number,,,,,,,,
"of studies that provided information on their programs, we based these analyses on all studies",,,,,,,,
"eligible for the recidivism analysis (i.e., those with at least a Level 2 rating on the Maryland",,,,,,,,
SMS) to provide sufficient sample sizes for analysis. Because of the small sizes and potential,,,,,,,,
"bias (stemming, perhaps, from researchers who provide more information on program charac-",,,,,,,,
"teristics because they are likely more closely connected with the program), we urge readers to",,,,,,,,
interpret these findings with caution.,,,,,,,,
Program Type,,,,,,,,
"We calculate odds ratios for four types of correctional education programs: ABE programs,",,,,,,,,
"high  school/GED  programs,  postsecondary  education  programs,  and  vocational  education",,,,,,,,
programs. The odds ratios are presented in Table 3.3. A limitation in interpreting these odds,,,,,,,,
ratios is that studies differed in the precision in which they classified their programs. For exam-,,,,,,,,

latter type would therefore be included in the vocational education category as well as in one,,,,,,,,
"of the other program categories. Consequently, the independent effects of the vocational and",,,,,,,,
academic components would remain inseparable because the studies do not generally disaggre-,,,,,,,,
gate the effects of each component or report on individual-level dosage and outcomes in a way,,,,,,,,
that would allow our analysis to disaggregate the effects. Because of the overlap in curricular,,,,,,,,
"exposure and the lack of specificity in dosage, the odds ratios for the different program types",,,,,,,,
"should not be compared directly with one another. In other words, we cannot say with certainty",,,,,,,,
"that the programs grouped in each category are pure examples of a given program type (e.g.,",,,,,,,,
"adult basic education or postsecondary education). Rather, they are programs that include at",,,,,,,,
least some components of that program type.,,,,,,,,
The results in Table 3.3 suggest that participation in a correctional education program—,,,,,,,,
regardless of the type of program—is associated with a reduction in recidivism. All four of,,,,,,,,
the odds ratios for program type are less than 1 and are statistically significant at p < 0.05.,,,,,,,,
"Although different programs serve inmates with different needs and skill sets—e.g., postsec-",,,,,,,,
ondary  education  programs  are  typically  administered  to  the  most  academically  advanced,,,,,,,,
inmates and ABE programs are typically administered to inmates with low levels of academic,,,,,,,,
attainment—the findings here suggest that correctional education may be an effective way to,,,,,,,,
prevent recidivism for prisoners across the spectrum of ability and academic preparedness.,,,,,,,,
"It  is  worth  noting  that  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  (Harlow,  2003)  reports  that",,,,,,,,
"approximately 68 percent of inmates in state prisons lack a high school diploma. Therefore,",,,,,,,,
high school/GED programs would be the most relevant and common approach to educating,,,,,,,,
"the majority of prisoners. In our meta-analysis, we were able to identify 28 effect size estimates",,,,,,,,
from 22 studies of high school/GED programs. The associated odds ratio for these programs,,,,,,,,
"is 0.70 (p < 0.05, 95 percent confidence interval = 0.64 to 0.77), indicating that the odds of",,,,,,,,
recidivating among inmates participating in high school/GED programs are 70 percent of the,,,,,,,,
odds of recidivating among similar inmates not participating in such programs.,,,,,,,,

"To determine the average cost of providing education to inmates, the average rate of rein-",,,,,,,,
"carceration, and the average cost of reincarceration (see Table 3.5), we obtained the following",,,,,,,,
"three inputs. First, we required an estimate of the cost per year per inmate for correctional",,,,,,,,
education. We used data from Bazos and Hausman (2004) who calculated the average cost,,,,,,,,
of correctional education programs per inmate participant using information from The Three,,,,,,,,
"States Study, which assessed the relationship between correctional programs and recidivism in",,,,,,,,
"Maryland, Minnesota, and Ohio for approximately 3,170 inmates (Steurer, Smith, and Tracy,",,,,,,,,
2003). We also used data from the 2007 Corrections Compendium Survey Update on Inmate,,,,,,,,
"Education Programs (Hill, 2008). These two sources estimated that the average annual cost of",,,,,,,,

"Second,  the  reincarceration  rate  affects  the  cost-effectiveness  of  the  intervention:  The",,,,,,,,

The Relationship Between Correctional Education and Recidivism    39,,,,,,,,
is associated with a 13 percentage point reduction in the risk of reincarceration three years fol-,,,,,,,,
lowing release.,,,,,,,,
A full analysis of the benefits and costs of correctional education was beyond the study’s,,,,,,,,
"scope. Besides accounting for the direct costs to a prison system, such an analysis would also",,,,,,,,
"need to account for other costs, such as the financial and emotional costs to victims of crime",,,,,,,,
"and to the criminal justice system as a whole, which could be much more substantial than our",,,,,,,,
"estimates above. Also, because few studies have investigated the effect of education for more",,,,,,,,
"than three years, we assumed that the effect of correctional education programs after three",,,,,,,,
"years is equal to zero. However, these programs may have a “protective effect,” diminishing the",,,,,,,,
odds of reincarceration for some years after release.,,,,,,,,

the possibility of heterogeneous effects across crimes and across individuals with different pro-,,,,,,,,
files. (It may be that education works better for people who have a lower-than-average tendency,,,,,,,,
to recidivate to begin with.),,,,,,,,
"In addition, a full benefit and cost analysis would need to account for the dynamics of",,,,,,,,
how people move in and out of prison over their lifetimes. Most studies look at the reduction,,,,,,,,
"in reincarceration rates over a short period of time (e.g., one-year). However, there is a lack of",,,,,,,,
"good data on lifetime reincarceration rates. Last, a full benefit and cost analysis would need to",,,,,,,,
factor in the costs associated with crime-causing activity that does not result in incarceration.,,,,,,,,
"In  the  late  1970s,  RAND  conducted  prisoner  surveys  in  Texas,  Michigan,  and  California.",,,,,,,,
"Using self-reported data, RAND found that the median number of crimes (excluding all drug",,,,,,,,
crimes) reported by prisoners in the year before their incarceration was 15.12 Data from more,,,,,,,,
"recent studies on self-reported criminal activity have yielded similar results (DiIulio and Piehl,",,,,,,,,
"1991; Levitt, 1996). Our analyses did not take into account the number and types of crimes",,,,,,,,
prevented by providing correctional education to prisoners.,,,,,,,,
Summary,,,,,,,,
When examining 71 effect size estimates from 50 studies of correctional education programs,,,,,,,,
"spanning 32 years of research with analyses ranging in methodological quality and rigor, the",,,,,,,,
majority of studies we identified showed lower rates of recidivism among inmates receiving cor-,,,,,,,,
rectional education than among inmates who did not receive correctional education. To pro-,,,,,,,,
"vide the best estimate of the causal relationship between correctional education and recidivism,",,,,,,,,
we examined nine effect size estimates from seven studies that received a Level 4 or Level 5,,,,,,,,
"rating on the Maryland SMS (i.e., the most rigorous research designs) and found that the odds",,,,,,,,
of recidivating among treatment group members are 43 percent lower than the odds of recidi-,,,,,,,,
vating among comparison group members. When applying these estimated odds to the most,,,,,,,,
"recently reported national rates of reincarceration (43.3 percent within three years of release),",,,,,,,,
correctional education would reduce reincarceration rates by 12.9 percentage points on aver-,,,,,,,,
"age, although effectiveness does appear to differ by program.",,,,,,,,
Our findings complement those detected in the most recent meta-analyses published by,,,,,,,,
"Wilson, Gallagher, and MacKenzie (2000); Aos, Miller, and Drake (2006); and MacKenzie",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"That is, the median number of crimes committed that were not caught or prosecuted.",,,,,,,,
40    Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
(2006)—all of which document that correctional education participants have lower rates of,,,,,,,,
"recidivism than nonparticipants. Unfortunately, all of these studies disaggregate their point",,,,,,,,
"estimates differently and do not use the same metric to report their findings. Hence, it is not",,,,,,,,
"possible to directly compare the size of the estimates across studies. However, that four inde-",,,,,,,,
pendently conducted meta-analyses with different methods and criteria yield consistent results,,,,,,,,
inmates will return to crime upon release.,,,,,,,,
"To  place  our  meta-analytic  findings  into  context,  we  undertook  a  cost  analysis  using",,,,,,,,
estimates from the literature of the direct costs of correctional education and of reincarcera-,,,,,,,,
tion. Focusing only on the direct costs of correctional education programs and of three-year,,,,,,,,
"be between $2.94 million and $3.25 million. In comparison, for those who did receive cor-",,,,,,,,
"rectional education, the three-year reincarceration costs are between $2.07 million and $2.28",,,,,,,,
million. This means that reincarceration costs are $0.87 million to $0.97 million less for those,,,,,,,,
who receive correctional education. Given that the costs of providing education to this group,,,,,,,,
"of  100  inmates  would  range  from  $140,000  to  $174,400,  providing  correctional  education",,,,,,,,
appears to be cost-effective when compared with the cost of reincarceration.,,,,,,,,
Another way to look at the cost-effectiveness of providing correctional education is to cal-,,,,,,,,
culate the break-even point—defined as the risk difference in the reincarceration rate required,,,,,,,,
for the cost of correctional education to be equal to the cost of incarceration. For a correctional,,,,,,,,
"education program to be cost-effective, we estimated that a program would need to reduce the",,,,,,,,
three-year reincarceration rate by between 1.9 percentage points and 2.6 percentage points to,,,,,,,,
"break even. In fact, our meta-analytic findings indicate that participation in correctional edu-",,,,,,,,
cation programs is associated with a 13 percentage-point reduction in the risk of reincarcera-,,,,,,,,
"tion three years following release. Thus, correctional education programs appear to far exceed",,,,,,,,
the break-even point in reducing the risk of reincarceration. Given that some programs appear,,,,,,,,
"more effective than others, the exact ratio of costs to benefits will naturally depend on the",,,,,,,,
effectiveness of a particular program. Future investments in correctional education would ide-,,,,,,,,
ally be designed in ways that allow for rigorous identification of effective programs’ features.,,,,,,,,
by the researcher to report differences in employment between the treatment and comparison,,,,,,,,
group members. We describe each of these dimensions below in turn.,,,,,,,,
"•	 Definition  of  employment.  Employment  is  defined  a  number  of  ways,  including  having",,,,,,,,
"ever worked part-time since release, having ever worked full-time since release, employed",,,,,,,,
"for a specified number of weeks since release, and employment status (i.e., employed or",,,,,,,,
common way employment was operationalized was through a variable indicating whether,,,,,,,,
the former inmate had ever worked full- or part-time since release (n = 9).,,,,,,,,
•	 Time period. Studies differed in the time period through which they followed the study,,,,,,,,
participants after release from prison. Studies ranged from examining a cohort of former,,,,,,,,
inmates in the community for three months since release from prison to following them,,,,,,,,
for 20 years since release from prison. The most frequently used time period in the 18,,,,,,,,
eligible studies was one year (n = 7).,,,,,,,,
•	 Statistical metric. Fifteen of the studies simply reported the percentage or a weighted mean,,,,,,,,
"of the treatment and comparison groups that were employed, and three of the studies",,,,,,,,
reported regression coefficients along with standard errors to express the magnitude of the,,,,,,,,
difference in employment between the treatment and the comparison groups.,,,,,,,,
42    Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
"When there were multiple outcomes and reporting methods used, we gave preference to",,,,,,,,
employment within one year of release or as close as possible to one year (as this represents,,,,,,,,
the modal time period used by the authors of the studies) and regression coefficients (as this,,,,,,,,
represents the best attempt by the authors of the studies to reduce potential sources of bias).,,,,,,,,
"However, as with our approach in our analysis of recidivism, we used whatever definition, time",,,,,,,,
"period, or statistical metric reported by the author so that we could be as inclusive as possible.",,,,,,,,
and thus should not be interpreted as any of the individual measures that make it up. Details,,,,,,,,
"information on the individual programs being studied, the research design used in the study,",,,,,,,,
"the WWC Scale and the Maryland SMS ratings of the study’s research design, and the rates",,,,,,,,
"of employment recorded for the treatment and comparison group, are shown in Appendix G.",,,,,,,,
We transformed all 22 effect size estimates from the 18 studies into 22 odds ratios. Recall,,,,,,,,
that the number of effect sizes exceeds the number of studies because a study could contain,,,,,,,,
"multiple treatment and comparison groups, and thus multiple comparisons. For our purposes,",,,,,,,,
the  odds  ratio  is  calculated  as  the  odds  of  obtaining  employment  among  treatment  group,,,,,,,,
members divided by the odds of obtaining employment among comparison group members.,,,,,,,,
"Odds ratios greater than 1 indicate that the treatment group had a higher rate of employment,",,,,,,,,
and odds ratios less than 1 indicate that the comparison group had a higher rate of employ-,,,,,,,,
ment. An odds ratio of 1 indicates that there is no difference between the treatment group and,,,,,,,,
the comparison group.1 These 22 odds ratios form the data points on which the random-effects,,,,,,,,
regression is estimated.,,,,,,,,
sizes to the right of this line indicate that the treatment group had a higher odds of obtaining,,,,,,,,

"As with our analysis of recidivism, it is possible that the findings for employment favorable",,,,,,,,
"to correctional education programs may be driven by selection bias, wherein motivated, work-",,,,,,,,
oriented inmates are selected (either by their own choice or by correctional program adminis-,,,,,,,,
"trators) to enroll in educational programs. Therefore, the observed differences in employment",,,,,,,,
between the treatment and comparison groups may reflect underlying differences in the types,,,,,,,,
of inmates that participate in correctional education and not the causal effect of the program,,,,,,,,
itself. To provide a better estimate of the potential causal relationship between program par-,,,,,,,,
"ticipation and employment, we recalculated the odds ratio for studies that fall at different levels",,,,,,,,
of the Maryland SMS scale. The odds ratios and their corresponding confidence intervals are,,,,,,,,
shown in Table 4.1. Ideally we would restrict our analyses to studies receiving a Level 4 or,,,,,,,,
"Level 5 rating on the Maryland SMS (as was done in our analysis of recidivism). However, as",,,,,,,,
"shown in this table, no studies with employment outcomes received a Level 5 rating and only",,,,,,,,
"one study received a Level 4 rating.2 Therefore, we cannot test whether the positive relationship",,,,,,,,
between correctional education participation and employment holds among studies with the,,,,,,,,
most scientifically defensible research designs. Although we do detect an employment advan-,,,,,,,,

as a potential explanation for this observed effect.,,,,,,,,

Role of Program Type and Method Used to Collect Employment Data,,,,,,,,
We conclude our analysis of employment by exploring whether the relationship we observe,,,,,,,,
between correctional education and the odds of obtaining employment varies varies by pro-,,,,,,,,
gram  type  and/or  the  method  used  to  collect  employment  data. The  scientific  review  team,,,,,,,,
"abstracted both of these variables during their assessment and coding of the studies, which fol-",,,,,,,,
lowed the review protocol shown in Appendix D. We use this information to recalculate our,,,,,,,,
odds ratios separately for vocational programs and nonvocational programs and separately for,,,,,,,,
"studies that relied on administrative data, surveys to parole officers, and surveys to inmates.",,,,,,,,
"We focus on these two dimensions, because they have substantive and methodological impli-",,,,,,,,

"field. Additionally, the data on these two variables are complete for our full sample of studies.",,,,,,,,
"Ideally, we would examine a broader range of program characteristics, but the data collected",,,,,,,,
"across studies were too inconsistent or incomplete. With a small pool of studies to examine,",,,,,,,,
we consider these analyses to be purely exploratory. We urge readers to interpret these findings,,,,,,,,
with that caveat in mind.,,,,,,,,

popular in correctional settings. We first provide a brief description of the computer-assisted,,,,,,,,
interventions themselves. As these studies are of clearly defined educational interventions (in,,,,,,,,
"contrast to most of the studies used in the recidivism and employment analyses), we describe",,,,,,,,
them in detail to provide context for the results. We then describe how we standardized test,,,,,,,,
"scores across the four eligible studies. Next, we pool effect size estimates from the four studies",,,,,,,,
to provide aggregate estimates of the relationship between computer-assisted instruction and,,,,,,,,
students’ academic performance in reading and mathematics. We then examine descriptive dif-,,,,,,,,

"study, the traditional classroom instruction was said to include “lecture, rote recitation, and",,,,,,,,
some team teaching” (p. 207). The software was described as mastery-based and was supple-,,,,,,,,
mented by nonelectronic materials. The PLATO classrooms were staffed by a teacher and an,,,,,,,,
aide in the Meyer et al. (1983) study and by a classroom teacher in the Diem and Fairweather,,,,,,,,
"(1980) study. In the Meyer et al. (1983) study, the intervention lasted approximately 2.5 hours",,,,,,,,
"per day for three months, at an implied rate of five days per week. In the Diem and Fairweather",,,,,,,,
"study, the intervention lasted eight weeks, but intensity and frequency were not specified.",,,,,,,,
The study by Batchelder and Rachal (2000) used a “tutorial/drill and practice” (p. 125),,,,,,,,
software  package  called  Advanced  Instructional  Management  System  (AIMS)  that  allowed,,,,,,,,
students to choose their focal areas and to progress at their own pace. It also provided diag-,,,,,,,,
nostic feedback on their progress. The software reportedly emphasized arithmetic and writing,,,,,,,,
"conventions, presenting students with lessons, sample problems to solve or essays to correct,",,,,,,,,
"feedback on their work, and chances to demonstrate learning from their mistakes. It was used",,,,,,,,
"to supplant face-to-face instructional time in mathematics, English, history, and science for",,,,,,,,
"one hour per day, five days a week, during a four-week period. AIMS classrooms were staffed",,,,,,,,
"by a facility employee rather than by a classroom teacher, and inmate peers were on hand to",,,,,,,,
assist with technical difficulties.,,,,,,,,
McKane and Greene (1996) assessed the AUTOSKILL Component Reading Subskills,,,,,,,,
"Program  (Fiedorowicz  and  Trites,  1987),  which  was  reportedly  designed  to  teach  cognitive",,,,,,,,
"subskills of reading, and particularly syllable and word recognition. It offered speeded drill and",,,,,,,,
"practice and supplanted an unspecified portion of the traditional, teacher-led literacy instruc-",,,,,,,,
tion that the students otherwise received. Both AUTOSKILL and traditional instruction class-,,,,,,,,
rooms were staffed by literacy instructors. Traditional instruction was reported to include a,,,,,,,,
"variety of literacy teaching methods, including the Laubach method, Steck-Vaughn tutoring,",,,,,,,,
"peer tutoring, and traditional classroom instruction.",,,,,,,,

Bachelder and Rachal (2000) and Diem and Fairweather (1980) earned 5s on the Maryland,,,,,,,,

Measuring Academic Performance,,,,,,,,
"For the meta-analysis, we limited our examination of academic performance to the two con-",,,,,,,,
"tent areas that were common to more than two studies—namely, mathematics and reading.",,,,,,,,
"These are policy-relevant measures, since they are building-block skills for other content areas,",,,,,,,,
and they are the two subjects that states are required to measure annually in public schools,,,,,,,,
"under the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Beyond these content areas, one study",,,,,,,,
"also included a language test (Meyer et al., 1983) and another included measures of vocabulary",,,,,,,,
"and spelling (Diem and Fairweather, 1980), but to include an outcome variable in the meta-",,,,,,,,
"analysis, we required at least three studies to measure that variable.",,,,,,,,
Each study employed one of three commercially available standardized tests to measure,,,,,,,,
"academic performance. All were paper-and-pencil examinations, and all used separate pretests",,,,,,,,
and  posttests  to  measure  changes  in  student  performance  over  time.  Information  provided,,,,,,,,
about the standardized tests is described below.,,,,,,,,
The Relationship Between Computer-Assisted Instruction and Academic Performance    51,,,,,,,,
"One  study  (Diem  and  Fairweather,  1980)  used  the  Adult  Basic  Learning  Examination",,,,,,,,
"(ABLE), Level II, which is designed to measure the performance of adult students performing",,,,,,,,
on a fifth- to eighth-grade level. Our analysis focused on the subscale scores in reading and,,,,,,,,
total arithmetic; the latter comprises computation and problem-solving subscales.,,,,,,,,
"One of the studies (Batchelder and Rachal, 2000) used the Comprehensive Adult Stu-",,,,,,,,
dent  Assessment  System  (CASAS)  mathematics  and  reading  scales.  This  test  is  reportedly,,,,,,,,
designed to measure performance from beginning levels through high school completion and,,,,,,,,
was reportedly “validated through field testing based on 15 years of assessment data from more,,,,,,,,
"than 2 million adult learners” (Batchelder and Rachal, 2000, citing the Comprehensive Adult",,,,,,,,
"Student Assessment System, 1996).",,,,,,,,
The other two studies used the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) scales in reading,,,,,,,,
"(Meyer, Ory, and Hinckley, 1983) or mathematics and reading (McKane and Greene, 1996).",,,,,,,,
"Meyer, Ory and Hinckley (1983) used the TABE M (medium level) as a pretest and TABE D",,,,,,,,
(difficult level) as a posttest. The former is reportedly designed to reliably measure performance,,,,,,,,
"at grades 3 through 10 and the latter, at grades 5 through 12. McKane and Greene (1996) did",,,,,,,,
"not specify the versions used, but both studies noted that the TABE is frequently used as a",,,,,,,,
measure of academic performance in correctional settings.,,,,,,,,
Creating a Common Performance Scale,,,,,,,,
To synthesize the results of studies that use different measures of academic performance with,,,,,,,,
"different testing scales, it is necessary to put the results in common units across studies. Many",,,,,,,,
studies and research syntheses have to create a common scale across disparate tests by convert-,,,,,,,,
"ing scores to standard deviation units or z-scores, where a standard deviation is defined as the",,,,,,,,
"average deviation from the mean across test-takers on a given assessment.1 In this case, however,",,,,,,,,
all of the test scores are reported in grade equivalents or in forms that can be easily converted,,,,,,,,
"to grade equivalents, so we use these as our common metric, thereby avoiding the need to use",,,,,,,,
"standard deviation units for different tests (Baguley, 2009).2 Grade-level equivalents have the",,,,,,,,
"additional benefit of being easily understood by policymakers and practitioners, because one",,,,,,,,
"unit is equal to a single, nine-month academic year of learning in a particular content area.",,,,,,,,
This metric typically refers to a standard scholastic setting rather than a correctional education,,,,,,,,
"setting, in which students receive approximately one hour of instruction in each of six to seven",,,,,,,,
"content areas for five days per week. As such, one month of learning (as reported on the ABLE,",,,,,,,,
"for instance, in Diem, 1980) would represent one-ninth of a grade-level equivalent. According",,,,,,,,
"to a publicly available report from the CASAS (2012), four scale score points on both the read-",,,,,,,,
"ing and mathematics scales represent a one-grade level difference. Consequently, we defined",,,,,,,,
a unit difference in CASAS score points as equal to one-quarter of a grade-level equivalent.,,,,,,,,
"For the two studies that used the TABE, results were already presented in terms of grade-level",,,,,,,,
equivalents. Because we were able to transform ABLE and CASAS scores linearly into grade-,,,,,,,,
52    Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
"level equivalents, and because TABE scores were already reported in grade-level equivalents,",,,,,,,,
we were able to report effects consistently across studies using this metric.3 Additional details,,,,,,,,

"information on the individual interventions, the research design used in the studies, the WWC",,,,,,,,
"and Maryland SMS ratings, and the test scores for the treatment and comparison groups, are",,,,,,,,
shown in Appendix H.,,,,,,,,
Results: Effects of Computer-Assisted Correctional Education on Student,,,,,,,,
Performance in Math and Reading,,,,,,,,
The four aforementioned studies include a total of nine effects. Three of the studies provide,,,,,,,,
"one math effect and one reading effect each, and one of the studies (McKane and Greene,",,,,,,,,
1996) contributes no math effect but does contribute separate reading effects for three distinct,,,,,,,,
"subgroups—students beginning at the third-grade reading level or lower, students beginning",,,,,,,,
"between the third- and sixth-grade levels, and students beginning above the sixth-grade level.",,,,,,,,
"In the studies that include both reading and mathematics estimates, there is complete overlap",,,,,,,,
"between the samples of reading and mathematics test-takers, meaning that the estimates for",,,,,,,,
"each content area are not independent within a given study. As a result, we present separate",,,,,,,,
meta-analytic estimates for reading and mathematics rather than combining the estimates into,,,,,,,,
a single academic achievement effect.,,,,,,,,
"These effect estimates for reading are summarized in a forest plot shown in Figure 5.1,",,,,,,,,
"and the estimates for mathematics are also shown in Figure 5.2. In each plot, the horizon-",,,,,,,,
tal axis represents the estimated effect of computer-assisted instruction relative to traditional,,,,,,,,
"instruction. As noted above, the effect estimates are denominated in grade-level equivalents, so",,,,,,,,
"that one unit corresponds to a single grade level of learning, or approximately the knowledge",,,,,,,,
"that would be gained in nine months of full-time classroom instruction, on average. For each",,,,,,,,
"study sample or subsample, and the size of the box is proportional to the size of the sample",,,,,,,,
or subsample. The horizontal line for each study represents the 95 percent confidence interval,,,,,,,,
"hand column of the figure. The overall, meta-analytic effect across studies is estimated as in",,,,,,,,
"prior chapters with a random effects regression analysis, which weights each effect according to",,,,,,,,
its sample size and the precision with which it is estimated.,,,,,,,,

Summary,,,,,,,,
Our meta-analyses of six reading effect estimates and three mathematics effect estimates from,,,,,,,,
face-to-face classroom instruction. The overall effect of computer-assisted instruction is esti-,,,,,,,,
mated at only about 0.36 months of learning in reading but at a more substantial three months,,,,,,,,
of learning in mathematics. Although the mathematics effect estimate is substantively mean-,,,,,,,,
"ingful, its confidence interval includes zero and, thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that it",,,,,,,,
"is due to chance alone. Moreover, as none of the prior meta-analyses on correctional education",,,,,,,,
"looked specifically at computer-assisted instruction and achievement, our findings cannot be",,,,,,,,
directly compared with existing work in this area.,,,,,,,,
The goal of this report was to address the question of what we know about the effectiveness of,,,,,,,,
correctional education—academic programs and vocational training programs—for incarcer-,,,,,,,,
"ated adults in U.S. state prisons. Specifically, we examined the evidence about the relationship",,,,,,,,
between correctional education and recidivism and postrelease employment outcomes and the,,,,,,,,
relationship between academic performance and computer-assisted instruction. These findings,,,,,,,,
"will inform policymakers, educators, and correctional education administrators interested in",,,,,,,,
understanding  the  association  between  correctional  education  and  reductions  in  recidivism,,,,,,,,
and improvements in employment and other outcomes.,,,,,,,,
"In  this  chapter,  we  summarize  our  overall  findings,  provide  specific  recommendations",,,,,,,,
"for strengthening the evidence base in this field, and discuss the policy implications and next",,,,,,,,
steps.,,,,,,,,
58    Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
"eral,  studies  that  included  ABE,  high  school/GED,  postsecondary,  and/or  vocational  train-",,,,,,,,
"ing programs showed a reduction in recidivism. However, it is not possible to disentangle the",,,,,,,,
"effects of these different types of educational programs, because of the overlap in curricular",,,,,,,,
"exposure and a lack of specificity about dosage. Thus, we cannot assert, for example, that high",,,,,,,,
school/GED programs have a greater effect on reducing recidivism than postsecondary educa-,,,,,,,,
tion programs.,,,,,,,,

tionship  between  vocational  training—versus  academic  correctional  education  programs—,,,,,,,,
"and postrelease employment, we found that individuals who participated in vocational train-",,,,,,,,
ing programs had odds of obtaining postrelease employment that were 28 percent higher than,,,,,,,,
"individuals who had not participated in vocational training. In comparison, individuals who",,,,,,,,
"participated in  academic  programs (combining ABE,  high school/GED, and postsecondary",,,,,,,,
education  programs)  had  only  8  percent  higher  odds  of  obtaining  postrelease  employment,,,,,,,,
than individuals who had not participated in academic programs. Although the results suggest,,,,,,,,
that vocational training programs have a greater effect than academic programs on one’s odds,,,,,,,,
"of obtaining postrelease programs, there was no statistically significant difference between the",,,,,,,,
odds ratios for the two types of programs.,,,,,,,,
We also examined the relationship between computer-assisted instruction and academic,,,,,,,,
performance—something that was not examined in any of the previous meta-analyses. In this,,,,,,,,
reviewed four studies3 that compared the achievement test scores of inmates receiving com-,,,,,,,,
"instruction. In two of the studies, students in both the treatment and comparison groups also",,,,,,,,
"received additional, traditional classroom instruction beyond the portion of their instructional",,,,,,,,
time that was computer-assisted. We limited our examination of academic performance to the,,,,,,,,
two content areas that were common to more than two studies—math and reading.,,,,,,,,
with 63.1 percent for those who had not.,,,,,,,,
land SMS.,,,,,,,,
Conclusions    59,,,,,,,,
We estimated that the overall effect of computer-assisted instruction relative to traditional,,,,,,,,
"instruction is 0.04 grade levels in reading, or about 0.36 months of learning, and 0.33 grade",,,,,,,,
"levels in mathematics, which represented about three months of learning. In other words, on",,,,,,,,
"exposed to traditional instruction for the same amount of instructional time. However, these",,,,,,,,
differences were not statistically significant and thus may be due to chance alone.,,,,,,,,
Because computer-assisted instruction can be self-paced and can be supervised by a tutor,,,,,,,,
"instructional technology has progressed (U.S. Department of Education, 2010), which sug-",,,,,,,,
gests that the effects of the newer technologies may potentially outstrip those found in the,,,,,,,,
"potential cost-effectiveness of computer-assisted technology, and the fact that the technology is",,,,,,,,
getting better suggest that its use in this context could be promising.,,,,,,,,
"State  policymakers,  corrections  officials,  and  correctional  education  administrators  are",,,,,,,,
"asking a key question: How cost-effective is correctional education? In other words, although",,,,,,,,
"than not providing them, such programs have costs. Thus, to place our meta-analytic findings",,,,,,,,
"into context, we undertook a cost analysis using estimates from the literature of the direct costs",,,,,,,,
"of correctional education programs and of incarceration itself, and using a three-year reincar-",,,,,,,,
ceration rate. Our estimates show that the direct costs of providing education to a hypothetical,,,,,,,,
"pool of 100 inmates would range from $140,000 to $174,400 with three-year reincarceration",,,,,,,,
costs being between $0.87 million to $0.97 million less for those who receive correctional edu-,,,,,,,,
"cation than for those who do not. This translates as a per inmate cost ranging from $1,400 to",,,,,,,,
"$1,744, suggesting that providing correctional education is cost-effective compared with the",,,,,,,,
cost of reincarceration. We also calculated the break-even point—defined as the risk difference,,,,,,,,
in the reincarceration rate required for the cost of correctional education to be equal to the cost,,,,,,,,
"of incarceration. For a correctional education program to be cost-effective, we estimated that",,,,,,,,
a program would need to reduce the three-year reincarceration rate by between 1.9 percent-,,,,,,,,
"age points and 2.6 percentage points to break even. In fact, our meta-analytic findings show",,,,,,,,
that participation in correctional education programs is associated with a 13 percentage point,,,,,,,,
"reduction in the risk of reincarceration three years following release from prison. Thus, cor-",,,,,,,,
rectional education programs appear to far exceed the break-even point in reducing the risk of,,,,,,,,
reincarceration.,,,,,,,,
Our  analysis  focused  only  on  the  direct  costs  of  correctional  education  programs  to,,,,,,,,
the prison system. A full analysis of the benefits and costs of correctional education besides,,,,,,,,
"accounting for the direct costs to a prison system would also need to account for other costs,",,,,,,,,

"and Drake, 2006).",,,,,,,,
"Last, in considering the above findings, it is important to keep in mind that the 2008",,,,,,,,
recession also had an effect on the field of correctional education. The recession affected cor-,,,,,,,,
"rectional education (and other rehabilitative) programs in a number of states, leading to some",,,,,,,,
"dramatic changes in the number of programs offered, the sizes of classes, the modes of delivery,",,,,,,,,
"and the number of inmates who participate in these programs. For example, funding for cor-",,,,,,,,
rectional education was reduced by 30 percent as part of California’s $1.2 billion budget reduc-,,,,,,,,
"As a result, approximately 712 teaching positions were eliminated, the number of vocational",,,,,,,,
"programs was reduced by nearly 50 percent, and the capacity of academic and vocational pro-",,,,,,,,
"grams was reduced by 3,300 and 4,500 slots, respectively. To reduce the effect of these cuts on",,,,,,,,
"capacity and to maximize enrollment, the California Department of Corrections and Reha-",,,,,,,,
"bilitation also developed five new education models with decreased program frequency, dura-",,,,,,,,
"tion, and options while maximizing the number of inmates with access to the programs. For",,,,,,,,
"example, under the new education models students would meet for three hours per day once",,,,,,,,
a week (which would allow for two sessions during the day) instead of meeting for 6.5 hours a,,,,,,,,
"day, five times a week under the old education model.",,,,,,,,
"In  Texas,  the  legislature  reduced  the  budget  for  its  state  prison  education  system  by",,,,,,,,
"approximately 27 percent, or $17.8 million per year over the next biennium (Windham School",,,,,,,,
"District, 2011–2012). To address the reduction in funding, 271 full-time equivalents (FTEs)",,,,,,,,
"were eliminated, all staff received reductions in salary, and other cuts were implemented (e.g.,",,,,,,,,
"to supplies, travel, and other operating budgets).",,,,,,,,
"In Oklahoma, budget cuts affected both academic and vocational programs. For exam-",,,,,,,,
"ple, appropriations to CareerTech (which runs the state prison Skills Centers that provide voca-",,,,,,,,
tional and technology training) declined by more than 15 percent between fiscal years 2009,,,,,,,,
"and 2012 (Wertz, 2012). Five of the state’s 15 prison Skills Centers were closed, resulting in the",,,,,,,,
"loss of vocational training capacity in welding, carpentry, masonry, plumbing, and electrical.",,,,,,,,
"Since 2008, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections lost one-third of its full-time education",,,,,,,,
staff and a similar percentage of its Skills Center instructors.,,,,,,,,
"Within  the  past  year,  there  has  been  an  uptick  in  funding  for  correctional  education,",,,,,,,,
with many state correctional education directors reporting either no further funding cuts or,,,,,,,,
even some minor increases in funding—a situation that has enabled them to begin modestly,,,,,,,,
"rebuilding  programs  (personal  communication,  Correctional  Education  Association  [CEA]",,,,,,,,
"Leadership Forum, 2012). That said, a reduced funding environment will likely be true for",,,,,,,,
"correctional education programs for the near future, and the return on investment of these",,,,,,,,
programs will likely continue to be a topic in state-level budget discussions.,,,,,,,,
The Need to Improve the Research Evidence Base for Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
"Using the most recent published studies in the field, we similarly find that the quality of the",,,,,,,,
"available research on correctional education is highly variable (Gaes, 2008; MacKenzie, 2008).",,,,,,,,
"Unlike authors of previous meta-analyses, we had more studies with which to assess the effec-",,,,,,,,
"tiveness of correctional education. However, although our meta-analyses, as did previous meta-",,,,,,,,
"analyses, accounted for the strength of the research designs of the various studies examined,",,,,,,,,
Conclusions    61,,,,,,,,
there are still a number of questions of interest to educators and policymakers that the current,,,,,,,,
"literature—with its variable research quality—does not permit us to address. For example, we",,,,,,,,
would want to look “inside the black box” of correctional education programs to try to under-,,,,,,,,
"stand what program elements (e.g., types of curriculum, mode of instruction, dosage, type of",,,,,,,,
instructors) are associated with effective programs with respect to reductions in recidivism and,,,,,,,,
improvements in postrelease employment outcomes.,,,,,,,,

,2.  Who benefits most from different types of correctional education programs?,,,,,,,

62    Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
well-executed RCT) or a Level 4 rating (a quasi-experimental design with very similar treat-,,,,,,,,
ment and comparison groups) on the Maryland SMS. Most of the studies were based on lower-,,,,,,,,
quality research designs (Level 3 and below on the Maryland SMS) that were susceptible to,,,,,,,,
"selection bias. Further, many studies did not report sufficient information about the sociode-",,,,,,,,
mographic characteristics and other characteristics of the treatment and comparison groups;,,,,,,,,
reporting on such information would allow for meaningful differences between the two groups,,,,,,,,
to be evaluated and the potential threat of selection bias to be quantified.,,,,,,,,
"To minimize this potential for bias, future studies should ideally employ research designs",,,,,,,,
"that that help to minimize it. The ideal design, of course, is an RCT, in which individuals are",,,,,,,,
"randomly assigned to the treatment group (e.g., those who receive vocational training) and to",,,,,,,,
"the control group (those who do not); however, RCTs may not always be practical or politically",,,,,,,,
feasible with a criminal justice population.,,,,,,,,
"When  an  RCT  is  not  possible,  two  other  alternatives  might  be  feasible—a  regression",,,,,,,,
discontinuity (RD) design and a propensity score matching/weighting design. Both alterna-,,,,,,,,
"tives are intended to minimize selection bias, although an RD design does so more rigorously,",,,,,,,,
"because it addresses selection on both unobserved and observed attributes, whereas propensity",,,,,,,,
"scores address only the latter. The RD design, when executed properly, would merit a Level",,,,,,,,
"5 on the Maryland SMS, in keeping with WWC standards for RDs (Schochet et al., 2010),",,,,,,,,
whereas a propensity score matching or weighting study would merit a Level 4 rating at best.,,,,,,,,
"Using  an  RD  approach,  assigning  inmates  to  the  treatment  group  would  be  based  on",,,,,,,,
a strict cut-point from a continuous measure that is judiciously applied to every inmate. For,,,,,,,,
"example, scores on the TABE may be used to select inmates to participate in a correctional",,,,,,,,
"education program, such that everyone directly above the cut-point is assigned to the program",,,,,,,,
"(i.e., to the treatment group) and everyone below the cut-point is assigned not to receive the",,,,,,,,
program (the control group).,,,,,,,,
A key assumption of the RD design is that there is a linear relationship between the selec-,,,,,,,,
"tion mechanism and the outcome, or that the relationship can be linearized. If this assumption",,,,,,,,
"holds and the design is properly implemented, then this design has very high internal validity.",,,,,,,,
"Because the assignment rule is fully understood and modeled, assignment is removed from the",,,,,,,,
"estimate of the treatment effect. To be implemented well, an RD design requires reasonably",,,,,,,,
"strong compliance with the assignment rule, although effects can be scaled for partial noncom-",,,,,,,,
pliance through an instrumental variable analysis. It is noteworthy that none of the studies in,,,,,,,,
our meta-analyses used an RD design.,,,,,,,,
Propensity score matching or weighting is possible when there is a range of information,,,,,,,,
collected  on  program  participants  and  nonparticipants—including  sociodemographic  infor-,,,,,,,,
"mation, prior criminal records, prior education and labor force experiences, cognitive function-",,,,,,,,
"ing, and, if possible, other personality and behavioral traits. This information can be used to",,,,,,,,
create a comparison group that is evenly balanced with the treatment group on the observed,,,,,,,,
"set of characteristics maintained in the data. In doing so, those in the comparison group have",,,,,,,,
approximately the same “propensity” to have enrolled in correctional education as those in the,,,,,,,,
treated group. This matching or weighting helps attenuate the threat of selection bias when,,,,,,,,
"making comparisons on the outcomes of interest, particularly when the set of characteristics",,,,,,,,
used to balance the treatment and comparison groups is extensive and includes variables most,,,,,,,,
likely to differentiate participants from nonparticipants.,,,,,,,,
"Among  the  studies  in  our  meta-analyses,  only  five  used  propensity  score  matching  or",,,,,,,,
"weighting, although many more (virtually all the Level 4 and some of the Level 3 studies) used",,,,,,,,
Conclusions    63,,,,,,,,
a  manual  matching  procedure  in  which  treated  inmates  were  matched  to  similar  untreated,,,,,,,,
inmates on key variables using administrative records. As long as the studies showed baseline,,,,,,,,
"equivalence between treatment and comparison groups on age, prior offenses, baseline educa-",,,,,,,,
"tional level, and time between release and data collection, they were assigned a Level 4, regard-",,,,,,,,
"less of the matching procedure used. However, the advantage of propensity score matching",,,,,,,,
over a manual matching procedure is that it can help researchers obtain baseline equivalence,,,,,,,,
over a much larger number of variables than one can typically achieve with a manual matching,,,,,,,,
"procedure (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983).",,,,,,,,
"In addition, identifying the appropriate comparison groups is important (Gaes, 2008).",,,,,,,,
Many of the studies reviewed in our meta-analyses used comparison groups of nonprogram,,,,,,,,
"participants but did not consider differences in terms of levels of education, certification, or",,,,,,,,
"training. As a result, the comparison group might be a mixture of inmates with varying levels",,,,,,,,
of academic achievement.,,,,,,,,
Gaes (2008) recommended that a study registry be established to help sort out the differ-,,,,,,,,
"ent effect sizes found across studies. Given the vast array of programs currently administered,",,,,,,,,
the dearth of basic information on their design and their effectiveness in a centralized system,,,,,,,,
precludes the effective utilization of resources—particularly for states making strategic deci-,,,,,,,,
sions on whether and how to recalibrate their programs to adjust to changes in funding and,,,,,,,,
changes in the prisoner population. Such a registry would include details about each study,,,,,,,,
"including information about the program and intervention, about the evaluation design, char-",,,,,,,,
"acteristics of the treatment and comparison groups, and outcomes measures used. The research",,,,,,,,
"summaries provided in Appendixes F, G, and H of this report serve as a potential template for",,,,,,,,
this type of information. The methodological and dissemination approach used by the U.S.,,,,,,,,
Department of Education’s What Works Clearinghouse could be adopted and adapted by the,,,,,,,,
corrections’ community to serve as a registry whereby programs are systematically cataloged,,,,,,,,
and reviewed—improving accountability on the part of the programs and building a high-,,,,,,,,
quality research base that can help better inform questions regarding what works best to effec-,,,,,,,,
tively educate incarcerated individuals.,,,,,,,,
Measuring Program Dosage,,,,,,,,
"Many practitioners have posed the question, What dosage level is associated with effective cor-",,,,,,,,
"rectional education programs? For instance, does it matter that an individual participates in",,,,,,,,
20 hours of academic instruction or is 30 hours of academic instruction required for a given,,,,,,,,
"course? In other words, how much correctional education is needed to be effective? Such ques-",,,,,,,,
"tions of dosage are especially salient now, when many correctional education programs have",,,,,,,,
experienced significant budget cuts.,,,,,,,,
"On average, the studies we reviewed lacked specific information about the dosage of the",,,,,,,,
"program, such as the overall program duration, the number and grade level of the courses in",,,,,,,,
"which inmates were enrolled, how many hours per day or week inmates were exposed to formal",,,,,,,,
"class instruction, and how many hours per day or week inmates worked on assignments out-",,,,,,,,
"side the classroom. In many of the studies, particularly those that were secondary analyses of",,,,,,,,
"administrative data sets, respondents were categorized simply as correctional education partici-",,,,,,,,
pants and nonparticipants. This crude categorization undoubtedly masked variation in expo-,,,,,,,,
"sure to the program among participants. For example, some inmates may have been enrolled",,,,,,,,
for a year; others may have been enrolled for a week and withdrawn.,,,,,,,,
64    Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
"individual studies in their proper contexts. Some studies may have produced null findings, not",,,,,,,,
because the program was ineffective if implemented as designed but because the average dosage,,,,,,,,
that the treatment group received was too small to make a difference. The lack of dosage infor-,,,,,,,,
mation means that there is little to no empirical evidence that can help inform policymakers,,,,,,,,
on how much correctional education is necessary to produce a change in the desired outcomes.,,,,,,,,
"In future studies, the proper recording of program dosage when collecting data and monitor-",,,,,,,,
ing the progress of inmates through correctional programs will be critical to enable researchers,,,,,,,,
to examine program dosage.,,,,,,,,
Conclusions    65,,,,,,,,
program efficacy will help to better elucidate the mechanisms that undergird the role of educa-,,,,,,,,
tion in the rehabilitation process.,,,,,,,,
"For example, collecting information on cognitive gains while inmates are enrolled in the",,,,,,,,
"program, additional education and training that inmates receive following their release, and",,,,,,,,
"more-detailed information about their postrelease employment (e.g., timing of employment,",,,,,,,,
"method  of  hiring,  wages,  occupation  type,  sector)  would  be  important.  Additionally,  with",,,,,,,,
"respect to employment, our analysis and other research studies recognize that solely relying on",,,,,,,,
"administrative records, which record only formal “on-the-books” jobs, may underestimate the",,,,,,,,
effect of correctional education. Studies that use supplemental ways of measuring labor market,,,,,,,,
"outcomes, such as surveys, are needed to better estimate the effect of correctional education on",,,,,,,,
postrelease employment.,,,,,,,,
Policy Implications,,,,,,,,
Our study demonstrates that correctional education improves the chances that inmates who,,,,,,,,
are released from prison will not return and may improve their chances of postrelease employ-,,,,,,,,
ment. Our findings are stable even when we limit our analyses to those studies with more rigor-,,,,,,,,
"ous research designs, and we find a notable effect across all levels of education, from adult basic",,,,,,,,
education and GED programs to postsecondary and vocational education programs. This is,,,,,,,,
"important, because the academic needs of inmates are heterogenous. Further, our cost analy-",,,,,,,,
sis suggests that correctional education programs can be cost-effective. And as noted by Gaes,,,,,,,,
"(2008), correctional education is a form of intervention that can affect almost every offender",,,,,,,,
compared with other types of rehabilitative services provided within prisons.,,,,,,,,
"At the same time, it is important to keep in mind that much is changing in the field of",,,,,,,,
"programs leading to major changes in the number of programs offered, the sizes of classes, the",,,,,,,,
"modes of delivery, and the number of inmates who participate in these programs. In addition,",,,,,,,,
"the implementation of the new GED exam in 2014 (GED Testing Service, undated)—which",,,,,,,,
will entail a more rigorous test aligned with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and,,,,,,,,
computer-based testing (CBT)—will be a new challenge for the field to adjust to and under-,,,,,,,,
scores the growing role of computer technology in correctional education.,,,,,,,,
"Going forward, there is a need to undertake studies that get inside the black box to iden-",,,,,,,,
"tify the characteristics of effective programs in terms of such elements as curriculum, instruc-",,,,,,,,
"tional practices, quality, and dosage. To inform policy and funding decisions at the state and",,,,,,,,
"federal  levels,  policymakers  need  additional  information  and  a  better  understanding  about",,,,,,,,
how these programs work (and what does not work). In addition to the need for more rigor-,,,,,,,,
"ously designed studies, we also need studies that drill down to examine different aspects of",,,,,,,,
"effective programs. For example, understanding how dosage may vary for different types of",,,,,,,,
effective programs would be useful information for administrators and policymakers who are,,,,,,,,
"weighing various trade-offs in terms of program duration, frequency, and capacity.",,,,,,,,
One option is for state and federal policymakers and foundations to invest in well-designed,,,,,,,,
"evaluations of correctional education programs to inform such policy questions. Also, research-",,,,,,,,
ers and program evaluators need to strive to implement rigorous research designs to examine,,,,,,,,
questions related to potential bias and program dosage. They should ideally strive to measure,,,,,,,,
"both proximal and distal outcomes, where the former refers to near-term outcomes, such as test",,,,,,,,
66    Evaluating the Effectiveness of Correctional Education,,,,,,,,
"scores or behavior in prison, and the latter to longer-term outcomes, such as postrelease recidi-",,,,,,,,
vism and employment. Funding grants and guidelines can help further the field by requiring,,,,,,,,
the use of more rigorous research designs. Such funding also would enable correctional educa-,,,,,,,,
tors to partner with researchers and evaluators to undertake rigorous and comprehensive evalu-,,,,,,,,
"ations of their programs. In addition, a study registry of correctional education evaluations",,,,,,,,
would further aid in the development of the evidence base in this field to help inform policy,,,,,,,,
"and programmatic decisionmaking. Knowing that these programs are cost-effective, if these",,,,,,,,
"programs were refined based on this important missing information, correctional education",,,,,,,,
might have the potential to yield even greater returns on investment.,,,,,,,,

Diagnostic Tests for Recidivism Analysis,,,,,,,,
"If all studies used samples from the same population, we would expect the observed variation",,,,,,,,
"in effect sizes to be random, with most (approximately 95 percent) studies’ confidence intervals",,,,,,,,
including the pooled effect size of 0.64. The patterning of the boxes and whiskers in Figure 3.1,,,,,,,,
indicates that this is not the case—and instead suggests that there is substantial heterogene-,,,,,,,,
ity in effect sizes that is above the level that would be expected due to random variation. The,,,,,,,,
"degree of heterogeneity can be formally assessed through the I2 statistic, which represents the",,,,,,,,
"percentage of variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity, rather than random varia-",,,,,,,,
"tion. In this meta-analysis, the value of I2 is 92 percent, indicating considerable amounts of",,,,,,,,
heterogeneity.,,,,,,,,
"The funnel plot, shown in Figure C.1, is used to look for evidence of publication bias. The",,,,,,,,
funnel plot shows shows each estimate of the odds ratio of recidivating on the x-axis and its,,,,,,,,
"standard error on the y-axis. If there were no publication bias, we would expect the points to",,,,,,,,
"be approximately symmetrically distributed around the central line, with the spread of points",,,,,,,,
points increasing as the standard error increases. The funnel plot indeed shows some increas-,,,,,,,,
"ing spread with increasing standard errors, but at the larger values of the standard error, the",,,,,,,,
"points are no longer distributed symmetrically. This suggests evidence of publication bias, as",,,,,,,,
we would expect smaller studies that found non-significant or negative results to be included,,,,,,,,
"in the plot in the lower right half, but these are missing from our search. That this portion of",,,,,,,,
the chart is relatively empty suggests that these studies may exist but have not been published.,,,,,,,,
The Egger regression test of non-symmetricality gives p < 0.05. This finding of publication bias,,,,,,,,
"suggests that our results may be biased upward (in other words, showing too large an impact",,,,,,,,
"on recidivism reduction). However, the publication bias is likely to be small, for three reasons:",,,,,,,,
(1) The number of missing studies is small—the addition of two effect sizes would balance the,,,,,,,,
funnel plot; (2) the missing studies are small and therefore unlikely to have a large effect on,,,,,,,,
our pooled effect size; and (3) two effect sizes are extremely low—such outliers are likely to,,,,,,,,
bias the results of the regression test. The alternative to the Egger regression test is the Begg,,,,,,,,
"non-parametric rank test, which is not affected by outliers. In that test, the p-value of 0.450 is",,,,,,,,
"non-significant, a finding consistent with no publication bias, though the exact p-value cannot",,,,,,,,
be calculated in the presence of ties.,,,,,,,,
"A second diagnostic test is a leave-one-out analysis. In this analysis, each effect size is",,,,,,,,
"sequentially removed from the dataset, and the meta-analysis is rerun. The effect is replaced,",,,,,,,,
and the next effect is removed. This analysis determines the extent to which our results are reli-,,,,,,,,
"ant on one study, and whether our conclusions will be changed with the exclusion of a particu-",,,,,,,,
lar effect. Table C.1 shows the odds ratios and confidence intervals for 70 meta-analyses—with,,,,,,,,
"each effect size removed. The table shows that the results are highly stable, and not dependent",,,,,,,,
on any particular study.,,,,,,,,

Diagnostic Tests for Employment Analysis,,,,,,,,
"As with the recidivism analysis, the forest plot for the employment analysis (Figure 4.1) shows",,,,,,,,
considerable  variation  and  non-overlapping  confidence  intervals.  The  degree  of  heterogene-,,,,,,,,
"ity is reflected in the I2 statistic, which is 90 percent, only slightly lower than for recidivism,",,,,,,,,
again indicating that there is a great deal of heterogeneity between the studies. The funnel plot,,,,,,,,
"(Figure C.2) shows that there is a possibility of publication bias, with small studies that have",,,,,,,,
either no effect or a negative effect apparently missing from the dataset. The regression test of,,,,,,,,
"non-symmetricality is statistically significant (p < 0.05), but the rank test is not (p = 0.503).",,,,,,,,
"However, as with the recidivism analysis, a small number of studies would balance the graph,",,,,,,,,
and therefore we do not feel that this is likely to indicate substantive bias in our results.,,,,,,,,
"The leave-one-out analysis, presented in Table C.2, shows that the pooled estimate and",,,,,,,,
confidence intervals are not greatly changed by the inclusion or exclusion of any one study.,,,,,,,,

Meta-Analysis Diagnostic Tests    79,,,,,,,,
Diagnostic Tests for Computer-Assisted Instruction Analysis,,,,,,,,
"The sample size for the computer-assisted instruction analysis was small, and hence the results",,,,,,,,
"of diagnostic tests will be less sensitive. Even pooling across math and reading analyses, the",,,,,,,,
studies were found to be considerably less heterogeneous than studies in the recidivism and,,,,,,,,
"employment analyses. I2 was equal to 0 percent, indicating that there was no greater heteroge-",,,,,,,,
neity than would have been expected by chance—and the p-value of the heterogeneity statistic,,,,,,,,
reflected this (p = 0.435). The funnel plot in Figure C.3 shows the possibility of some publica-,,,,,,,,
"tion bias, with a possible asymmetry in the lower left-hand side; however, the tests of asym-",,,,,,,,
"metry were not statistically significant, regardless of whether the regression test (p = 0.196) or",,,,,,,,
rank test (p = 0.180) was used.,,,,,,,,
The leave-one-out analysis is presented in Table C.3. It shows that the pooled estimate,,,,,,,,
"across math and reading, which is 0.15 grade level equivalents but is not statistically significant",,,,,,,,
"(95% CI: –0.05 to 0.35), is  not markedly altered by the exclusion of any one study. The confi-",,,,,,,,
"dence interval includes 0, indicating no statistically significant effect, in all cases.",,,,,,,,
