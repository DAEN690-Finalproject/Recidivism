"Each year, thousands of incarcerated individuals leave the nation’s prisons and jails and return",,,,,,,,,,,,
to their families and communities. While many successfully reintegrate into their communi-,,,,,,,,,,,,

"return to jail or prison. For juveniles involved in the juvenile justice system, the rate of youth",,,,,,,,,,,,
incarceration in the United States is more than three times the highest rates in other developed,,,,,,,,,,,,
nations. Although many factors account for why some formerly incarcerated adults and youth,,,,,,,,,,,,
"succeed and some don’t, lack of education and skills is one key reason. This is why correctional",,,,,,,,,,,,
education programs—both academic and vocational—are provided in correctional facilities,,,,,,,,,,,,
across the nation. But do such correctional education programs actually work? We care about,,,,,,,,,,,,
the answer because we want ex-prisoners to successfully reenter communities and because we,,,,,,,,,,,,
have a responsibility to use taxpayer dollars judiciously to support programs that are backed by,,,,,,,,,,,,
evidence of their effectiveness—especially during difficult budgetary times like these. Across,,,,,,,,,,,,

in 2010 to comprehensively examine the current state of correctional education for incarcer-,,,,,,,,,,,,

improve the field moving forward. The study conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review,,,,,,,,,,,,
"respectively,  and a survey of states’ correctional education directors  to  understand  concerns",,,,,,,,,,,,
and emerging trends.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The results of the meta-analysis are truly encouraging. Confirming the results of previ-,,,,,,,,,,,,
ous meta-analyses—while using more (and more recent) studies and an even more rigorous,,,,,,,,,,,,
approach to selecting and evaluating them than in the past—the study shows that correctional,,,,,,,,,,,,
education for incarcerated adults reduces the risk of postrelease reincarceration (by 13 percent-,,,,,,,,,,,,
age points) and does so cost-effectively (a savings of five dollars on reincarceration costs for,,,,,,,,,,,,
every dollar spent on correctional education). And when it comes to postrelease employment,,,,,,,,,,,,
for adults—another outcome key to successful reentry—researchers find that correctional edu-,,,,,,,,,,,,

reading  improvement)  and  a  personalized  and  intensive  approach  piloted  at  the  Avon  Park,,,,,,,,,,,,
Youth Academy in Florida (for diploma completion and postrelease employment).,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because the landscape in  which correctional education occurs has  been altered  by  the,,,,,,,,,,,,
"recent recession, researchers surveyed state correctional education directors to help get a pulse",,,,,,,,,,,,
on what is going on and what concerns states face. Some key insights from the survey include,,,,,,,,,,,,
the recognition that the 2008 recession and its long aftermath have had dramatic and nega-,,,,,,,,,,,,
tive effects on correctional education spending; that there is a growing emphasis on providing,,,,,,,,,,,,
vocational education programming that will lead to industry or nationally recognized certifi-,,,,,,,,,,,,
cations; that the importance of computer technology in correctional education is growing but,,,,,,,,,,,,
use of technology is mixed and access to the Internet by incarcerated students is very limited;,,,,,,,,,,,,
GED exam and computer-based testing; and that while a large number of states are provid-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ing postsecondary education, most is paid for by inmates or their families, not by states or the",,,,,,,,,,,,
federal government.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Overall, this study shows that the debate should no longer be about whether correctional",,,,,,,,,,,,
"opportunities to move the field forward. In that vein, the study argues for a need to fund research",,,,,,,,,,,,
that both improves the evidence base that the study shows is lacking and gets inside the “black,,,,,,,,,,,,
"box” of interventions to answer questions about the dosage associated with effective programs,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"the most effective models of instruction and curriculum in a correctional setting, and who",,,,,,,,,,,,
benefits most from different types of correctional education programs. Having such knowl-,,,,,,,,,,,,
edge is key to telling us which programs should be developed and funded—which programs,,,,,,,,,,,,
will provide the greatest return on taxpayer dollars. The study also shows the field is ripe for,,,,,,,,,,,,
larger-scale randomized trials and natural experiments that look at the impacts of correctional,,,,,,,,,,,,
education provided to juveniles and that can shed much-needed light on what works in these,,,,,,,,,,,,
settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,
And there is a need for research that investigates the impact of broader trends in cor-,,,,,,,,,,,,
rections for correctional education in particular. These include the increasing use of privately,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the size of their state prison population at the “front end” (for example, by reducing prison",,,,,,,,,,,,
youth in the community if at all possible instead of placing them in correctional institutions,,,,,,,,,,,,
and of keeping them at the local versus the state level.,,,,,,,,,,,,

recommendations in this study are intended to ensure that moving forward we understand,,,,,,,,,,,,
how to best leverage academic and vocational education programs to improve the reentry out-,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Each year, more than 700,000 incarcerated individuals leave federal and state prisons; within",,,,,,,,,,,,
"three years of release, 40 percent will have committed new crimes or violated the terms of their",,,,,,,,,,,,
release and be reincarcerated. Although a number of factors impede the ability of ex-offenders,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to successfully reintegrate into communities and, thus, affect recidivism rates, one key factor",,,,,,,,,,,,
"is that many ex-offenders do not have the knowledge, training, and skills to support a success-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ful return to their communities. Research, for example, shows that ex-offenders, on average,",,,,,,,,,,,,
are less educated than the general population: 37 percent of individuals in state prisons had,,,,,,,,,,,,
"attained less than a high school education in 2004, compared with 19 percent of the general",,,,,,,,,,,,
"U.S. population age 16 and over; 16.5 percent of state prisoners had just a high school diploma,",,,,,,,,,,,,
compared with 26 percent of the general population; and 14.4 percent of state prison inmates,,,,,,,,,,,,
"had at least some postsecondary education, compared with 51 percent of the general U.S. adult",,,,,,,,,,,,
"population. Moreover, literacy levels for the prison population also tend to be lower than that",,,,,,,,,,,,
of the general U.S. population.,,,,,,,,,,,,
mented across different settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The study was designed to address the following key questions of importance to the field,,,,,,,,,,,,
of correctional education:,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.  What is known about the effectiveness of correctional education programs for incarcer-,,,,,,,,,,,,
ated adults?,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.  What is known about the effectiveness of correctional education programs for juvenile,,,,,,,,,,,,
offenders?,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.  What  does  the  current  landscape  of  correctional  education  look  like  in  the  United,,,,,,,,,,,,
"States, and what are some emerging issues and trends to consider?",,,,,,,,,,,,
4.  What recommendations emerge from the study for the U.S. Department of Justice and,,,,,,,,,,,,
"other federal departments to further the field of correction education, and where are",,,,,,,,,,,,
"there gaps in our knowledge? What promising practices, if any, emerge from this review",,,,,,,,,,,,

How Effective Are Correctional Education Programs for Incarcerated Adults?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In terms of the effectiveness of correctional education programs for incarcerated adults, early",,,,,,,,,,,,
reviews in this area found inconclusive evidence to support their efficacy—a finding that con-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tributed to the popular belief that “nothing works” in prisoner rehabilitation; however, this",,,,,,,,,,,,
"conclusion may have been premature, given that appropriate analytic techniques had not been",,,,,,,,,,,,
"developed. More recent reviews, using meta-analysis techniques, question the conclusions of",,,,,,,,,,,,
"the earlier work, finding evidence of a relationship between correctional education program",,,,,,,,,,,,
"and MacKenzie, 2000; MacKenzie, 2006; Aos, Miller, and Drake, 2006). However, the most",,,,,,,,,,,,
"recent  meta-analyses  (Aos,  Miller,  and  Drake,  2006;  MacKenzie,  2006)  did  not  consider",,,,,,,,,,,,
"employment outcomes; thus, whether program participation is associated with postrelease suc-",,,,,,,,,,,,
cess in the labor market remained unclear.,,,,,,,,,,,,
These  earlier  reviews  provide  the  context  for  the  current  systematic  review  and  meta-,,,,,,,,,,,,
analysis. Our systematic review scanned the universe of potential documents to compile all,,,,,,,,,,,,
available empirical research studies that examine the effect of correctional education programs,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on the three outcomes of interest—recidivism, postrelease employment, and reading and math",,,,,,,,,,,,
"scores. This search yielded 1,112 documents, of which 267 were identified as primary empirical",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ate an eligible intervention, defined here as an educational program administered in a jail or",,,,,,,,,,,,
"prison in the United States published (or released) between January 1, 1980, and December 31,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"2011; (2) measure the effectiveness of the program using an eligible outcome measure, which for",,,,,,,,,,,,
"our meta-analysis included recidivism, postrelease employment, and achievement test scores;",,,,,,,,,,,,
"and (3) have an eligible research design, which, for our purposes, is one where there is a treat-",,,,,,,,,,,,
ment group comprising inmates who participated in or completed the correctional education,,,,,,,,,,,,
program and a comparison group of inmates who did not.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of the 267 primary empirical studies, 58 met all three eligibility criteria.1 With respect",,,,,,,,,,,,
"to recidivism, based on the higher-quality research studies, we found that, on average, inmates",,,,,,,,,,,,
who participated in correctional education programs had a 43 percent lower odds of recidivating,,,,,,,,,,,,
"than inmates who did not, thus indicating that correctional education is an effective strategy",,,,,,,,,,,,
for reducing recidivism.2 This estimate is based only on nine effect sizes from studies that met,,,,,,,,,,,,
"higher levels of rigor (i.e., earned 4s or 5s on the Maryland Scientific Methods Scale), but the",,,,,,,,,,,,
results were very similar even when the lower-quality studies were included in the analysis. This,,,,,,,,,,,,
pated in correctional education programs versus those who did not.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"xvi    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"When aggregating across 18 studies that used employment as an outcome, we found that",,,,,,,,,,,,
the odds of obtaining employment postrelease among inmates who participated in correctional edu-,,,,,,,,,,,,
cation (either academic or vocational/CTE programs) were 13 percent higher than the odds for those,,,,,,,,,,,,
"who did not. However, the findings are only suggestive about whether correctional education",,,,,,,,,,,,
is an effective strategy in improving postrelease employment outcomes because only one of the,,,,,,,,,,,,
"18 studies was of higher quality (level 4 or higher), thus limiting our ability to make a more",,,,,,,,,,,,
definitive statement.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When aggregating across four studies that used achievement test scores as an outcome, we",,,,,,,,,,,,
found that learning gains in both reading and math among inmates exposed to computer-assisted,,,,,,,,,,,,
instruction methods.3,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although doing a formal cost-effectiveness analysis was beyond the scope of this study,",,,,,,,,,,,,
we wanted to provide some context for what the meta-analysis findings mean. Focusing on the,,,,,,,,,,,,
"outcome of recidivism and using a hypothetical pool of 100 inmates, we compared the direct",,,,,,,,,,,,
costs of correctional education programs and of incarceration itself. We found that the direct,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More specifically, for a correctional education program to be cost-effective—or breakeven—we",,,,,,,,,,,,
estimated that it would need to reduce the three-year reincarceration rate by between 1.9 per-,,,,,,,,,,,,
centage points and 2.6 percentage points. Given that our findings indicate that participation,,,,,,,,,,,,
in correctional education programs is associated with a 13-percentage-point reduction in the,,,,,,,,,,,,
exceed the break-even point in reducing the risk of reincarceration. We also note that the results,,,,,,,,,,,,
"are likely to be conservative, because they do not include the indirect costs of reincarceration.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Summary    xvii,,,,,,,,,,,,
18 studies were deemed eligible for the systematic review by having met three criteria: (1) be,,,,,,,,,,,,
"program, with an eligible population, defined as consisting primarily of individuals age 20 or",,,,,,,,,,,,
"which juveniles are confined because of arrest, court proceedings, or adjudication/conviction;",,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) use eligible outcome measures, defined as any measure of recidivism (e.g., rearrest, reconvic-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"tion,  or  reincarceration),  postrelease  employment,  academic  attainment  (e.g.,  GED  or  high",,,,,,,,,,,,
"school completion), and academic performance (e.g., test scores in reading and mathematics);",,,,,,,,,,,,
and (3) have an eligible research design. This includes a comparison-group design in which a group,,,,,,,,,,,,
of incarcerated juveniles who received an intervention is compared with a group of incarcerated,,,,,,,,,,,,
"juveniles who did not, or who received a different version of the treatment. We also included a",,,,,,,,,,,,
"class of approaches called single-case designs, which involve systematically introducing an inter-",,,,,,,,,,,,
vention with one or a few students in an effort to demonstrate causal effects on outcomes such,,,,,,,,,,,,
as participant behavior or learning. These studies typically include a large number of pre- and,,,,,,,,,,,,
"post-intervention outcome measurements, allowing students to function as their own controls.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because these designs usually focus on only a handful of participants, they typically preclude",,,,,,,,,,,,
"traditional hypothesis testing. This means that their findings cannot be generalized to a larger,",,,,,,,,,,,,
hypothetical population of interest.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our  systematic  review  reveals  great  heterogeneity  in  terms  of  interventions,  methods,",,,,,,,,,,,,
and outcomes of interest. Among the 18 eligible studies we identified (16 comparison-group,,,,,,,,,,,,
"six categories—Corrective Reading (a commercially packaged curriculum), computer-assisted",,,,,,,,,,,,
"instruction,  personalized  instruction,  other  remedial  education,  vocational  education,  and",,,,,,,,,,,,
GED completion. Studies in the first two categories focused on packaged and branded read-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ing interventions (Corrective Reading, Read 180, Fast ForWord, and TUNEin to READING)",,,,,,,,,,,,
and focused on reading performance as the dependent variables of interest. Studies in the latter,,,,,,,,,,,,
"three categories focused on a broader set of outcomes, including not only reading and math-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ematics performance but also measures such as diploma completion, postrelease employment,",,,,,,,,,,,,
and postrelease recidivism.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given  the  small  number  of  studies  in  each  category,  we  cannot  easily  extrapolate  the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"effects  of  differential  dosages  or  implementation  approaches.  However,  taken  in  conjunc-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"tion with the broader research literature on each of the interventions examined, our system-",,,,,,,,,,,,
atic review does identify two interventions that show particular promise: Read 180 (for reading,,,,,,,,,,,,
improvement) and Florida’s Avon Park Youth Academy (for diploma completion and postrelease,,,,,,,,,,,,
employment). Both of these interventions are supported by a large and rigorous study within,,,,,,,,,,,,
"juvenile correctional settings, and the effectiveness of Read 180 is further substantiated by sev-",,,,,,,,,,,,
eral large and well-executed studies outside of correctional facilities. Beyond these compelling,,,,,,,,,,,,
"studies, we find that evidence for two other packaged interventions, Corrective Reading and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"TUNEin to Reading, is positive, but the underlying studies are too small to warrant general-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ization. Evidence concerning vocational education/CTE and GED completion is also positive,",,,,,,,,,,,,
but the underlying research designs are vulnerable to selection bias. This limits the quality of,,,,,,,,,,,,
conclusions that can be drawn about these programs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"xviii    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
What Is the Current Correctional Education Landscape and What Trends Are,,,,,,,,,,,,
Important?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When we began the correctional education study, we recognized early on that the 2008 reces-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"sion had a substantial effect on the field of correctional education, with many states reporting",,,,,,,,,,,,
meta-analysis and adult systematic review were undertaken. Understanding these differences,,,,,,,,,,,,
helps us to put our review results in context and provides the basis for forward-looking policy,,,,,,,,,,,,
recommendations.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In July 2013, we fielded the RAND Correctional Education Survey to help fill a critical",,,,,,,,,,,,
void in our understanding of the organization and delivery of academic and vocational educa-,,,,,,,,,,,,
tion/CTE to incarcerated adults. This web-based survey of correctional education directors in,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all 50 states provides us with insights into how states dealt with the recession of 2008, how",,,,,,,,,,,,
"correctional education is currently provided to incarcerated adults in the United States, what",,,,,,,,,,,,
"technology is being used, and how states fund correctional education. We also gathered infor-",,,,,,,,,,,,
mation on preparations for the new 2014 GED exam. We classified the size of state by the,,,,,,,,,,,,
adult prison population in 2012 and considered small states to have an adult prison population,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the range 1–24,999; medium states, in the range 25,000–49,999; and large states, 50,000",,,,,,,,,,,,
"or more adult prisoners. The overall response rate was 46 out of 50 states, or 92 percent. Of",,,,,,,,,,,,
"these 46, 42 completed the entire questionnaire, and four provided only partial responses to",,,,,,,,,,,,
the survey. Forty of the respondents had responsibility for both adult correctional education,,,,,,,,,,,,
and vocational training in their state; five respondents for academic education only; and one,,,,,,,,,,,,
respondent for vocational training only.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Variation in Correctional Education Programming Across the States,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2013, most states offered adult basic education, GED courses, and vocational education/",,,,,,,,,,,,
"CTE  programs,  and  most  reported  having  special  education  courses  available.  Higher-level",,,,,,,,,,,,
educational programming such as adult secondary education and postsecondary education was,,,,,,,,,,,,
"offered in 32 of the states, although smaller states were less likely to do so. Postsecondary edu-",,,,,,,,,,,,
cation courses today in 28 states are primarily paid for by the individual inmate or by family,,,,,,,,,,,,
"finances; in 16 states, state funding is used to cover the costs of postsecondary education, and",,,,,,,,,,,,
12 states reported using college or university funds.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Participation  in  correctional  education  programs  is  mandatory  in  24  states  for  adult,,,,,,,,,,,,
"inmates without a high school diploma or GED, and in 15 states it is mandatory for adults",,,,,,,,,,,,
"below a certain grade level, with smaller states less likely to require mandatory participation.",,,,,,,,,,,,
An emerging trend is a growing emphasis on providing vocational education/CTE pro-,,,,,,,,,,,,
gramming that will lead to industry or nationally recognized certifications. Smaller states were,,,,,,,,,,,,
more likely to emphasize vocational education/CTE training for state prisoners than medium-,,,,,,,,,,,,
sized or large states.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Impact of the 2008 Recession,,,,,,,,,,,,
The effect of the 2008 recession was an overall 6 percent decrease on average in states’ cor-,,,,,,,,,,,,
rectional education budgets between fiscal years (FYs) 2009 and 2012. The largest impact on,,,,,,,,,,,,
"budgets was felt by medium-sized and large states (on average, a 20 percent and 10 percent",,,,,,,,,,,,
Summary    xix,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tion was $3,479 in FY2009, compared with $3,370 in FY2012—this represented a 5 percent",,,,,,,,,,,,
decrease on average in the dollars spent per student.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The result was a contraction in the capacity of academic education programs and an overall,,,,,,,,,,,,
decrease of 4 percent on average in the number of adult students who participated in these,,,,,,,,,,,,
"programs, with medium-sized and large states experiencing somewhat larger decreases (10 per-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"cent and 8 percent, respectively, compared with a 1 percent decrease for small states). In addi-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"tion, 20 states reduced the number of course offerings for academic programs during this time",,,,,,,,,,,,
period.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The  effect  of  the  staffing  and  capacity  cost-cutting  measures  on  teachers  for  academic,,,,,,,,,,,,
"programs was particularly felt in medium-sized and large states. Overall, there was, on aver-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"age, a 4 percent decrease in the number of academic teachers who were employees. The largest",,,,,,,,,,,,
"decrease occurred in medium-sized and large states (on average, 44 percent and 20 percent,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"respectively, compared with a 5 percent decrease for small states).",,,,,,,,,,,,
Vocational education/CTE programs seemed to have fared somewhat better during the reces-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"vocational education/CTE programs and in the number of instructors. On average, there was",,,,,,,,,,,,
a 1 percent increase in the number of students enrolled in vocational/CTE programs between,,,,,,,,,,,,
"FYs 2009 and 2012. However, this appears to be largely driven by an increase, on average, of",,,,,,,,,,,,

"demand for a skilled workforce (Karoly, 2013). Further, distance learning and online instruc-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"tion are growing trends in the United States, with increasingly more educational courses being",,,,,,,,,,,,
offered online by either colleges or virtual high schools. Computer-assisted instruction is also,,,,,,,,,,,,
appealing in offering the opportunity to tailor instruction and coursework to the needs of the,,,,,,,,,,,,
individual student.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The importance of computing skills for today’s job market is recognized by state correc-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tional education directors, as reflected by the fact that 24 states reported offering a Microsoft",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Office certification as part of their vocational education/CTE programs. However, our survey",,,,,,,,,,,,
results indicate that the role of computer technology in correctional education is a mixed story.,,,,,,,,,,,,
reporting the use of desktop computers (either standalone or networked) and 17 states report-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ing the use of laptops. However, access to the Internet and the use of Internet-based instruction",,,,,,,,,,,,
"reported that only teachers and instructors have access to live Internet technology. In 26 states,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"xx    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"inmate students lack access to any Internet technology, and in only 16 states do inmate stu-",,,,,,,,,,,,
dents have access to simulated Internet programs. In terms of instructional methods that use,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some type of technology, only ten states reported that they had closed-circuit television, and",,,,,,,,,,,,
only a few states reported using it to provide one-way or interactive video/satellite instruction.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Readiness for the 2014 GED Exam and Computer-Based Testing,,,,,,,,,,,,
The GED is the predominant way that inmates earn their high school equivalency diplomas,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Harlow,  2003),  and  GED  completion  is  often  a  prerequisite  for  many  vocational  training",,,,,,,,,,,,
"programs. The 2014 GED exam not only represents a more rigorous test, being aligned with",,,,,,,,,,,,
"the Common Core State Standards (CSS), but will also rely on a new test delivery model—",,,,,,,,,,,,
"namely, computer-based testing to replace the old paper-and-pencil exam (Lockwood et al.,",,,,,,,,,,,,
2013). This represents a profound change to states and one that presents some key challenges.,,,,,,,,,,,,
GED completion rates were seen as an important outcome indicator to track by 40 states,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that took part in our survey. Yet, of the 31 states planning to implement the 2014 GED exam,",,,,,,,,,,,,
14 states expected that the more rigorous GED exam and the use of computer-based testing,,,,,,,,,,,,
may have a negative effect on the number of adult inmates who will be prepared to take the,,,,,,,,,,,,
"new exam, and 16 states expected a negative effect on GED completion rates. This was particu-",,,,,,,,,,,,
larly true for the medium-sized and large states.,,,,,,,,,,,,
All but two of the 31 states planning to implement the 2014 GED exam expressed con-,,,,,,,,,,,,
cerns about the new exam and computer-based testing. Nineteen states were concerned about,,,,,,,,,,,,
"their teachers being adequately prepared to teach the new GED exam, and 24 of the states were",,,,,,,,,,,,
concerned about the length of time it may take to prepare students for the more rigorous exam.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition, 12 of the states reported concerns that limited access to computers may preclude",,,,,,,,,,,,
"some students from taking the new GED exam. Also, responding directors in 14 of the states",,,,,,,,,,,,
reported concerns that their teachers may not be adequately prepared to implement computer-,,,,,,,,,,,,
based testing. Other concerns expressed were the cost to the individual student and the cost,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alternative high school equivalency exams. In general, smaller states expressed fewer concerns;",,,,,,,,,,,,
"however, our survey results suggest that states with the majority of the prison population (i.e.,",,,,,,,,,,,,
medium-sized and large states) expect to encounter a number of challenges in implementing,,,,,,,,,,,,
the new GED exam and test delivery system.,,,,,,,,,,,,
What Are Some Key Recommendations for Moving Forward?,,,,,,,,,,,,
This study’s key finding is that correctional education is effective in reducing recidivism for,,,,,,,,,,,,
"education/CTE  programs,  in  improving  individuals’  likelihood  of  postrelease  employment.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Also, our cost analysis showed that correctional education is highly cost-effective for incarcer-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ated adults: For every dollar spent on correctional education, five dollars are saved on three-",,,,,,,,,,,,
year reincarceration costs. But the available literature provides less certainty on the effective-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ness of correctional education for incarcerated juveniles—some practices are clearly promising,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"but the knowledge base is thin. Still, the debate should no longer be about whether correctional",,,,,,,,,,,,
"education is effective or cost-effective; rather, the debate should focus on where the gaps in our",,,,,,,,,,,,
knowledge are and opportunities to move the field forward.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Summary    xxi,,,,,,,,,,,,
We  offer  some  recommendations  and  next  steps  that  are  drawn  from  our  evaluation,,,,,,,,,,,,
"results; while this report is to the U.S. Attorney General, these recommendations will also be",,,,,,,,,,,,
of interest to other federal departments and agencies focused on reentry. These recommenda-,,,,,,,,,,,,
tions are intended to provide a roadmap for building on the gains made to date in educating,,,,,,,,,,,,
incarcerated individuals to improve their chances of success upon release and reentry into local,,,,,,,,,,,,
communities.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Correctional Education for Adults,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our survey results provide solid evidence about the dramatic impact the 2008 recession had on,,,,,,,,,,,,
correctional education in the United States. The recession and its long aftermath led to a reduc-,,,,,,,,,,,,
tion in correctional education spending and a decrease in the number of incarcerated adults,,,,,,,,,,,,
who participate in these programs. This raises the question of whether the trade-offs we are,,,,,,,,,,,,
making in terms of cost savings today with reductions in educational programming are worth-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while, considering the future costs of reincarceration and the effect that such lost opportunities",,,,,,,,,,,,
may have on individuals’ chances of finding employment and being successful in reintegrating,,,,,,,,,,,,
back into society. State corrections directors want to know how they can modify their models,,,,,,,,,,,,
of education to trim their budgets while still maintaining the effectiveness of their programs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The results of our meta-analysis (Davis et al., 2013) show that correctional education programs",,,,,,,,,,,,
"are dramatically effective in reducing recidivism, and there is some evidence of improvements",,,,,,,,,,,,
to postrelease employment outcomes. We also showed that correctional education programs,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dence base, we cannot answer the other critical questions needed to inform discussions about",,,,,,,,,,,,
modifications to educational programming in a resource-constrained environment. We concur,,,,,,,,,,,,
with MacKenzie’s (2008) assessment that we still are unable to get at what is inside the “black,,,,,,,,,,,,
"box” of what works in correctional education, to answer such questions as:",,,,,,,,,,,,
ated individuals and what skills will be needed in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Correctional Education for Juveniles,,,,,,,,,,,,
Based on our systematic review of the literature on education provided to juveniles in institu-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tional settings, we believe that the field is ripe for larger-scale randomized trials. Two of the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"studies we reviewed, Loadman et al.’s (2011) Read 180 study and the National Council on",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Crime  and  Delinquency’s  (2009)  Avon  Park  study,  suggest  that  such  studies,  though  chal-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"lenging to undertake, are feasible. The literature is also ripe for rigorous evaluations of natural",,,,,,,,,,,,
using  naturally  occurring  random  assignment  to  harsh  judges.  Studies  that  take  advantage,,,,,,,,,,,,
of rigorous causal methods in juvenile settings can shed much-needed light on what works in,,,,,,,,,,,,
these settings. Several of the smaller randomized trials we include in our review have noted,,,,,,,,,,,,
the difficulties of high student turnover in correctional facilities and of simply gaining permis-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sion to undertake research in these facilities (Shippen et al., 2012; Calderone et al., 2009). As",,,,,,,,,,,,
"such, we recommend that the focus be on developing larger-scale randomized trials and",,,,,,,,,,,,
rigorous evaluations of natural experiments. Such research efforts will clearly take time to,,,,,,,,,,,,
"researchers and correctional facilities. Because such partnerships take time to establish, there",,,,,,,,,,,,
may also be a federal role in galvanizing them. The U.S. Department of Education Institute of,,,,,,,,,,,,
Education Science’s recent grant program for supporting research partnerships between school,,,,,,,,,,,,
"systems and researchers offers one potential model. Informed by such partnerships, facilities",,,,,,,,,,,,
can make increasingly evidence-based decisions that not only improve their students’ prospects,,,,,,,,,,,,
but also reduce the social incidence of crime and delinquency.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Implications of Broader Trends in Corrections for Correctional Education,,,,,,,,,,,,
Several trends in the field of adult and juvenile corrections have important implications for,,,,,,,,,,,,
"correctional education that merit further consideration. First, many states are undertaking mea-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"“front-end”  strategies—such  as  reducing  prison  admissions,  diverting  offenders  to  county-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"rather  than  state-level  institutions,  or  changing  felonies  to  misdemeanors—and  “back-end”",,,,,,,,,,,,
strategies—such as reducing sentence lengths through earned credits or good time and revoca-,,,,,,,,,,,,
tions for probationers and parolees. All these changes in the correctional landscape have impli-,,,,,,,,,,,,
cations for how we think about providing academic education and vocational education/CTE,,,,,,,,,,,,
"county jails now have some inmates serving sentences of two, three, or more years instead of",,,,,,,,,,,,
"the typical length of stay of two to three months. However, county jails are not set up to pro-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"vide rehabilitative services over the long term, including academic programs and vocational/",,,,,,,,,,,,
CTE programs. The result of various states and localities implementing strategies to keep low-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"level offenders at the local level is that, in some instances, we may end up with a two-tiered",,,,,,,,,,,,
"system of education where, ironically, more serious offenders who serve their sentence in state",,,,,,,,,,,,
who serve their sentences in county jails. Such policy changes also raise other questions: Are,,,,,,,,,,,,
there  differences  in  access  to  academic  education  and  vocational  education/CTE  programs,,,,,,,,,,,,
depending on the setting where one serves one’s sentence? Are there differences in educational,,,,,,,,,,,,
and employment outcomes for offenders who serve their time at the local level compared with,,,,,,,,,,,,
offenders serving their sentence in state prison systems?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"xxiv    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second, a long-term trend in the field of juvenile corrections is to keep youth in the community",,,,,,,,,,,,
versus the state level. Our systematic review focused on what works with incarcerated youth in,,,,,,,,,,,,
part because the broader literature on educational interventions for juvenile offenders outside,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is to identify interventions that improve juveniles’ educational, employment, and recidivism",,,,,,,,,,,,
"outcomes in less-restrictive settings, such as alternative schools or traditional schools. To guide",,,,,,,,,,,,
"policy improvements, stronger federal reporting requirements about local correctional educa-",,,,,,,,,,,,
tion practices could help facilitate improved state and local comparisons of program effects.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whether collected federally or privately, a central repository of such information (e.g., staff-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ing levels and expertise, curriculum used, hours of instruction provided, types of programs",,,,,,,,,,,,
offered) would provide a valuable tool to policymakers and researchers alike.,,,,,,,,,,,,
we recommend that policymakers seek to assess and understand the implications,,,,,,,,,,,,
of these trends in the field of corrections with respect to their impact on correctional,,,,,,,,,,,,
education.,,,,,,,,,,,,
We are particularly grateful for the guidance and feedback provided throughout this project,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overview,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Each year, more than 700,000 incarcerated individuals leave federal and state prisons; within",,,,,,,,,,,,
"three years of release, 40 percent will have committed new crimes or violated the terms of their",,,,,,,,,,,,
release and be reincarcerated. Although a number of factors impede the ability of ex-offenders,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to successfully reintegrate into communities and, thus, affect recidivism rates, one key factor is",,,,,,,,,,,,
"that ex-offenders do not have the knowledge, training, and skills to support a successful return",,,,,,,,,,,,
"to their communities. Research, for example, shows that ex-offenders, on average, are less edu-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"2    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
The stigma of having a felony conviction on one’s record also is often a key barrier to,,,,,,,,,,,,
"postrelease employment (Pager, 2003). Holzer, Raphael, and Stoll (2003) conducted a series",,,,,,,,,,,,
of surveys of employers in four major U.S. cities and found that employers were much more,,,,,,,,,,,,
averse to hiring ex-offenders than they were in hiring any other disadvantaged group. Willing-,,,,,,,,,,,,
ness to hire ex-offenders was greater for jobs in construction or manufacturing than for those,,,,,,,,,,,,
opposed to nonviolent drug offenders.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally, individuals being released to the community face a very different set of demands",,,,,,,,,,,,
"for skill sets in today’s job market than ever before, with the growing importance of informa-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"tion technology and the need for basic computer skills (Karoly, 2013).",,,,,,,,,,,,
Given  these  gaps  in  educational  attainment  and  vocational  skills  and  the  impact  they,,,,,,,,,,,,
"have on ex-offenders, one strategy is to provide education to inmates while they are incarcer-",,,,,,,,,,,,
ated so that they have the skills to support a successful return to their communities. Prisoner,,,,,,,,,,,,
education (or correctional education) in the United States dates back more than 200 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Support for educational programs within correctional settings has waxed and waned over time,,,,,,,,,,,,
crime control.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although the general consensus today is that education is a useful component of the reha-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bilitation process, the question remains, how useful is it? This question has been particularly",,,,,,,,,,,,
salient as the nation as a whole and states have struggled with the need to make spending cuts,,,,,,,,,,,,
to all social programs throughout the recession of 2008 and its long aftermath.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On April 9, 2008, the Second Chance Act (SCA) (Pub. L. 110-199) was signed into law.",,,,,,,,,,,,
This important piece of legislation was designed to improve outcomes for individuals who are,,,,,,,,,,,,
"incarcerated, most of whom will ultimately return to communities upon release. The SCA’s",,,,,,,,,,,,
grant programs are funded and administered by the Office of Justice Programs within the U.S.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Department of Justice. In 2010, funding was set aside under the SCA to, for the first time,",,,,,,,,,,,,
conduct  a  comprehensive  study  of  correctional  education.  The  Office  of  Justice  Programs’,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) awarded the RAND Corporation a cooperative agreement,,,,,,,,,,,,
to comprehensively examine the current state of correctional education for incarcerated adults,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and juveniles, where it is headed, which correctional education programs are effective, and how",,,,,,,,,,,,
effective programs can be implemented across different settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our study was designed to address the following key questions of importance to the field,,,,,,,,,,,,
of correctional education:,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction    5,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for successful rehabilitation. Adult basic education and GED programs were being provided,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"vocational training programs were being given a high priority, and postsecondary education",,,,,,,,,,,,
programs were being offered through prison release and correspondence courses (Ryan and,,,,,,,,,,,,
"McCabe, 1994). However, by the 1980s support among the public and policymakers for cor-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"rectional education once again waned, and funding for education in prison suffered dramatic",,,,,,,,,,,,
"cuts (Lillis, 1994). Approximately half of correctional systems made cuts in inmate education",,,,,,,,,,,,
"programs, especially in vocational and technical training, with corrections officials citing state",,,,,,,,,,,,
"budget cuts as the main reason for most program reductions (Lillis, 1994).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the 1980s, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) initiated mandatory education starting",,,,,,,,,,,,
with the establishment of its first mandatory adult basic education program in 1982 and fol-,,,,,,,,,,,,
lowed by a requirement in 1983 that each institution have its own qualified reading specialist,,,,,,,,,,,,
"or special educator instructor (Ryan and McCabe, 1994). By 1986, the standard for mandatory",,,,,,,,,,,,
"education in the BOP system was an eighth-grade achievement level. Subsequently, a number",,,,,,,,,,,,
of states followed the BOP’s example in requiring that inmates attend school for a minimum,,,,,,,,,,,,
number of months if they did not have a specified reading level or had not received a high,,,,,,,,,,,,
"school diploma or GED (Steurer et al., 2010).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Higher Education Act, passed in 1965, provided student loans via Pell college tuition",,,,,,,,,,,,
grants to any qualified students (including incarcerated individuals) to help pay for their post-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"secondary education (Crayton and Neusteter, 2008). However, in the mid-1990s the Violent",,,,,,,,,,,,
Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-332) eliminated federal and,,,,,,,,,,,,
"state inmate eligibility for Pell college tuition grants, thus, affecting many college programs for",,,,,,,,,,,,
"inmates (Taylor, 2005). Additionally, limitations were placed on the amount of federal adult",,,,,,,,,,,,
education and vocational education/CTE funds available for correctional education programs,,,,,,,,,,,,
"participation in postsecondary correctional education programs dropped 44 percent (Marks,",,,,,,,,,,,,
1997).,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2007, the Second Chance Act (SCA) (Pub. L. 110-199) was enacted to improve out-",,,,,,,,,,,,

"were released from prisons, jails, and juvenile residential facilities and returning to communi-",,,,,,,,,,,,

"interagency priority at the federal level. In 2010, the SCA for the first time set aside dedicated",,,,,,,,,,,,
"funding for correctional education, which led to this RAND study.",,,,,,,,,,,,
The  2008  recession  deeply  affected  correctional  systems.  States  were  forced  to  curtail,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In 2012, anecdotal evidence suggests an uptick in funding for correctional education in",,,,,,,,,,,,

cation programs and the continuing need to demonstrate a return on investment. In the face of,,,,,,,,,,,,
"budgetary pressures, and to inform future budget decisions, state legislatures and departments",,,,,,,,,,,,
of  corrections  are  asking  fundamental  questions:  How  effective  are  these  programs?  What,,,,,,,,,,,,
return on investment do they provide?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Researchers have attempted to answer these questions before. In 1975, Lipton, Martinson,",,,,,,,,,,,,
and Wilks published a systematic review of 231 studies of prisoner rehabilitation programs and,,,,,,,,,,,,
concluded that there was no conclusive evidence that correctional education was beneficial.,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Once all data were abstracted and verified, each study was rated in terms of its scientific",,,,,,,,,,,,

studies effectively mitigated the threat of selection bias. This form of bias occurs either when,,,,,,,,,,,,

"findings across the outcome domains. In the table, we interpret the difference in each outcome",,,,,,,,,,,,
between the treatment and comparison group for all studies regardless of the quality of the,,,,,,,,,,,,
study design and then only for the most rigorous studies. We note the total number of studies,,,,,,,,,,,,
that contributed to the finding (n) and whether the finding was statistically significant at con-,,,,,,,,,,,,

"effectiveness of correctional education for each outcome. In the remainder of this section, we",,,,,,,,,,,,
"discuss the recidivism, postrelease employment, and achievement score findings in the table in",,,,,,,,,,,,
more detail.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Relationship Between Correctional Education and Recidivism,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recidivism is one of the most commonly used measures of effective prisoner rehabilitation in,,,,,,,,,,,,
"criminal justice research, because it conveniently indicates how much individuals are able to",,,,,,,,,,,,
successfully re-integrate back into their communities and desist from further criminal activity.,,,,,,,,,,,,
primary outcome measure.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, when we looked across studies, we found that recidivism was defined a number",,,,,,,,,,,,
"of ways; these definitions included reoffending, rearrest, reconviction, reincarceration, techni-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"cal parole violation, and successful completion of parole. We used whatever form of recidivism",,,,,,,,,,,,
the study authors reported so that we could be as inclusive as possible. In addition to how they,,,,,,,,,,,,
"defined recidivism, studies varied in the time period through which they followed the study",,,,,,,,,,,,
"participants after release from prison, ranging from six months to over ten years. When there",,,,,,,,,,,,
"were multiple outcomes and/or time periods reported, we gave preference to reincarceration",,,,,,,,,,,,
(because this represents the modal definition of recidivism used by the authors of the studies;,,,,,,,,,,,,
n = 34) and recidivism measured within one year of release or as close as possible to one year,,,,,,,,,,,,
of release (because this represents the modal time period used by the authors of the studies;,,,,,,,,,,,,
n = 13).,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For our analysis of recidivism, the treatment group consisted of inmates who participated",,,,,,,,,,,,
in  or  completed  a  correctional  education  program  and  the  comparison  group  consisted  of,,,,,,,,,,,,
inmates who did not participate in or complete the correctional education program.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The top row of Table 2.1 summarizes the results of our recidivism meta-analysis. When,,,,,,,,,,,,
we aggregated across all 50 studies—which represent 32 years of empirical assessments of the,,,,,,,,,,,,
"studies, and our test score analysis is based on nine effect sizes from four studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,

"designs, we conclude that correctional education is an effective strategy for reducing recidivism.6",,,,,,,,,,,,
The Relationship Between Correctional Education and Postrelease Employment,,,,,,,,,,,,
Postrelease  employment  is  an  important  measure  of  correctional  education’s  effectiveness,,,,,,,,,,,,
because it indicates how much the training and skills received while incarcerated prepare indi-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"viduals to enter and succeed in the formal labor market. However, unlike the case with recidi-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"vism, fewer eligible studies used employment as the outcome (n = 18).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like recidivism, postrelease employment was defined a number of ways, including having",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ever worked part-time since release, having ever worked full-time since release, having been",,,,,,,,,,,,
"employed for a specified number of weeks since release, and employment status at the time of",,,,,,,,,,,,
"data collection. Additionally, studies varied in the time period through which they followed",,,,,,,,,,,,
"the study participants after release from prison, ranging from three months to 20 years. When",,,,,,,,,,,,
"there  were  multiple  outcomes  and/or  time  periods  reported,  we  gave  preference  to  having",,,,,,,,,,,,
ever worked full- or part-time since release (because this represents the modal definition of,,,,,,,,,,,,
postrelease employment used by the study authors; n = 9) and employment measured within,,,,,,,,,,,,
one year of release (because this represents the modal time period used by the study authors;,,,,,,,,,,,,
n = 7).,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For our analysis of postrelease employment, the treatment group consisted of inmates who",,,,,,,,,,,,
"participated in or completed a correctional education program, and the comparison group con-",,,,,,,,,,,,
sisted of inmates who did not participate in or complete the correctional education program.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The second row of Table 2.1 summarizes the results of our postrelease employment meta-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"analysis. When aggregating across all 18 eligible studies, we find that the odds of obtaining",,,,,,,,,,,,
postrelease employment among inmates who participated in correctional education programs,,,,,,,,,,,,
are 13 percent higher than the odds of obtaining postrelease employment among inmates,,,,,,,,,,,,
who did not. This relationship is statistically significant at p < 0.05. Unlike with our analy-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sis of recidivism, we cannot assess how much this finding is robust to the threat of selection",,,,,,,,,,,,
"bias, because there is only one study that can be classified as having a rigorous research design.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Although this one study (which used matching to create a comparison group) did find statisti-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cally significant higher rates of postrelease employment among treatment group members, it",,,,,,,,,,,,
"assessed only one program, and, thus, it is not possible to generalize this finding to the array of",,,,,,,,,,,,
programs in operation. Given that we find significantly higher rates of postrelease employment,,,,,,,,,,,,
among treatment group members when looking at all eligible studies but cannot rule out the,,,,,,,,,,,,
tially an effective strategy for improving the postrelease employment prospects of inmates.7,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Relationship Between Correctional Education and Test Scores,,,,,,,,,,,,
Test  scores—reading  and  math—measure  the  immediate  cognitive  gains  that  result  from,,,,,,,,,,,,
exposure to educational programming and are common metrics used in studies that seek to,,,,,,,,,,,,
"measure educational effectiveness. Unfortunately, only four studies in our systematic review",,,,,,,,,,,,
"used test scores as an outcome. As mentioned earlier, these four studies specifically evaluated",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"school/GED programs, postsecondary) programs, and vocational certification programs.",,,,,,,,,,,,

"ness of this particular instructional approach, one that is becoming increasingly common in",,,,,,,,,,,,

gregate by the quality of the research design. All four studies used reading test scores as an out-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"come, and three of the four studies used math test scores as an outcome, as shown in Table 2.1.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"We converted the outcomes into grade equivalents, where one unit is equal to a single",,,,,,,,,,,,
nine-month academic year of learning in a particular content area. This metric typically refers,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to a standard scholastic setting rather than a correctional education setting, in which students",,,,,,,,,,,,
receive approximately one hour of instruction in each of six to seven content areas for five days,,,,,,,,,,,,
"per week. Unlike the studies of recidivism and employment, the treatment groups for these",,,,,,,,,,,,
four  studies  include  those  who  were  taught  through  computer-assisted  instruction  and  the,,,,,,,,,,,,
comparison groups included those who were taught through traditional face-to-face methods.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The third row of Table 2.1 summarizes the results of our reading test score meta-analysis,",,,,,,,,,,,,
and the fourth row of Table 2.1 summarizes the results of our math test score meta-analysis.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"greater gains than inmates receiving traditional face-to-face instruction. Specifically, we find",,,,,,,,,,,,
"lent to about 0.36 months of learning in reading and three months of learning in math. However,",,,,,,,,,,,,
reading and math among inmates exposed to computer-assisted instruction are similar to learning,,,,,,,,,,,,
gains made by inmates taught through traditional instruction methods.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because  computer-assisted  instruction  can  be  self-paced  and  can  be  supervised  by  a,,,,,,,,,,,,
"person other than a licensed classroom teacher, it may be less costly to administer and could",,,,,,,,,,,,
even allow correctional facilities to expand their instructional course offerings. For these rea-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sons, the finding of no statistically significant difference between computer-assisted and tra-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ditional (face-to-face) instruction suggests that, based on current evidence, computer-assisted",,,,,,,,,,,,
"instruction may be a reasonable alternative to traditional, face-to-face classroom instruction in",,,,,,,,,,,,
correctional facilities. It is also true that the technology underlying computer-assisted instruc-,,,,,,,,,,,,
tion has improved (and will continue to improve) over time relative to the four studies assessed;,,,,,,,,,,,,
this suggests that the effect of computer-assisted technology relative to traditional instruction,,,,,,,,,,,,
"methods may be larger than it appears in our assessment. Given that we only had four studies,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"the most recent of which was published in 2000, more research is needed to understand the",,,,,,,,,,,,
efficacy of this instructional approach as it is currently being implemented.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Results of Comparing Correctional Education and Reincarceration Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although our meta-analysis shows that correctional education is effective at reducing recidi-,,,,,,,,,,,,
outweighed by the costs of providing the correctional education programs. Although a formal,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cost-effectiveness analysis was beyond the scope of our study, to place our meta-analytic find-",,,,,,,,,,,,

How Effective Is Correctional Education for Incarcerated adults?    17,,,,,,,,,,,,
education and those of incarceration.8 The cost analysis is done for a three-year window after,,,,,,,,,,,,
release from prison. The detailed methodology of how we created the cost estimates can be,,,,,,,,,,,,

"To estimate the direct costs of providing education to inmates, we obtained three inputs.",,,,,,,,,,,,

"which assessed the relationship between correctional programs and recidivism in Maryland,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Minnesota, and Ohio for approximately 3,170 inmates (Steurer, Smith, and Tracy, 2003). We",,,,,,,,,,,,
also used data from the 2007 Corrections Compendium Survey Update on Inmate Education,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Programs (Hill, 2008). These two sources estimated that the average annual cost of correc-",,,,,,,,,,,,

"Second,  the  reincarceration  rate  affects  the  cost-effectiveness  of  the  intervention:  The",,,,,,,,,,,,

"correctional education. Thus, we found that the direct costs of reincarceration were far greater",,,,,,,,,,,,
than the direct costs of providing correctional education.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another way to look at the cost-effectiveness of providing correctional education is to cal-,,,,,,,,,,,,
culate the break-even point—defined as the risk difference in the reincarceration rate required,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the cost of correctional education to be equal to the cost of incarceration. For a correc-,,,,,,,,,,,,
tional education program to be cost-effective—or break even—we estimated that a program,,,,,,,,,,,,
would need to reduce the three-year reincarceration rate by between 1.9 percentage points and,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.6 percentage points. In fact, our meta-analytic findings indicate that participation in cor-",,,,,,,,,,,,
rectional education programs is associated with a 13 percentage-point reduction in the risk of,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reincarceration three years following release. Thus,  correctional education programs appear to",,,,,,,,,,,,
far exceed the break-even point in reducing the risk of reincarceration. Given that some programs,,,,,,,,,,,,
"appear more effective than others, the exact ratio of costs to benefits will naturally depend on",,,,,,,,,,,,
the effectiveness of a particular program. Future investments in correctional education would,,,,,,,,,,,,
ideally be designed to allow for rigorous identification of effective programs’ features.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Summary,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this chapter, we provided an overview of our systematic review and meta-analysis of studies",,,,,,,,,,,,
"of correctional education programs administered to adults. As part of our review, we identi-",,,,,,,,,,,,

adequate treatment and comparison groups.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based  on  the  higher-quality  research  studies,  we  found  that,  on  average,  inmates  who",,,,,,,,,,,,
participated in correctional education programs had 43 percent lower odds of recidivating than,,,,,,,,,,,,
inmates who did not. This translates to a reduction in the risk of recidivating of 13 percentage,,,,,,,,,,,,
"points, suggesting that correctional education is an effective strategy for reducing recidivism.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"When aggregating across 18 studies that used employment as an outcome, the odds of",,,,,,,,,,,,
obtaining employment postrelease among inmates who participated in correctional education,,,,,,,,,,,,
(either academic or vocational education/CTE programs) were 13 percent higher than the odds,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for those who did not. However, only one of the 18 studies had a high-quality research design,",,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,
"15–20 in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011; Sickmund et al., 2013). By comparison,",,,,,,,,,,,,
roughly 1 percent of the U.S. adult population was being held in prisons and jails in the same,,,,,,,,,,,,
"year (Glaze and Parks, 2012, U.S. Census Bureau, 2011), so the rate of juvenile incarceration",,,,,,,,,,,,
"is markedly lower than that for adults. In addition, the number of incarcerated youth in the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"United States has declined steadily in the past decade and a half, dropping from about 105,000",,,,,,,,,,,,
"in 1997 (Sickmund et al., 2013). Despite this promising trend, incarceration rates among juve-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"niles are still far higher in the United States than in other developed nations. In 2002, the",,,,,,,,,,,,
proportion  of  incarcerated  juveniles  among  12  developed  nations  ranged  from  a  hundred-,,,,,,,,,,,,
thousandth of a percent in Japan to about seven-hundredths of a percent in New Zealand and,,,,,,,,,,,,
"South Africa (Hazel, 2008).1 The rate of youth incarceration in the United States is therefore",,,,,,,,,,,,
more than three times the highest rates in other developed nations.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this chapter, we define incarcerated youth as individuals under age 21 who are legally",,,,,,,,,,,,
"assigned to correctional facilities as a result of arrest, detainment for court proceedings, adju-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"dication by a juvenile court, or conviction in an adult criminal court (Office of Juvenile Justice",,,,,,,,,,,,
"and Delinquency Prevention, 2013). It is important to note, however, that correctional facili-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ties are themselves a heterogeneous category. As of 2011, the largest share of incarcerated youth",,,,,,,,,,,,
"were housed in short-term detention centers (34 percent), followed by group homes (30 per-",,,,,,,,,,,,
cent) and long-term secure facilities (27 percent).2 A smaller proportion were confined in ranch,,,,,,,,,,,,
"or wilderness camps (4 percent), shelters (2 percent), reception centers (2 percent), and boot",,,,,,,,,,,,
"camps (1 percent) (Sickmund et al., 2013). Importantly, these proportions exclude a nontrivial",,,,,,,,,,,,
"number of juveniles tried in adult criminal courts or confined in adult facilities. As of 2011, an",,,,,,,,,,,,
"estimated 10,000 youth on any given day were being held in adult jails and prisons (National",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Juvenile Justice Network, 2011).",,,,,,,,,,,,
Among individuals incarcerated in juvenile correctional facilities in the United States in,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2011, about 86 percent were male, and the population included a marked overrepresentation",,,,,,,,,,,,
"of youth of color (Sickmund et al., 2013). Forty percent of incarcerated youth were black and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"22    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"23 percent were Hispanic, as compared with about 13 percent and 17 percent, respectively, in",,,,,,,,,,,,
"the U.S. population at large. White, non-Hispanic youth made up 32 percent of the incarcerated",,,,,,,,,,,,
"juvenile  population,  as  compared  with  63  percent  of  the  U.S.  population  (Sickmund  et",,,,,,,,,,,,
"correctional facilities in 2011 were under the age of 16. Another 55 percent were ages 16 or 17,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"and 14 percent were ages 18 to 20 (Sickmund et al., 2013).3",,,,,,,,,,,,
Juvenile offenders hail disproportionately from challenging circumstances. According to,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2003 data from the nationally representative Survey of Youth in Residential Placement, 56 per-",,,,,,,,,,,,
cent of incarcerated youth reported that they had been living with only one parent at the time,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of commitment, and 26 percent reported that they had been living with neither parent. Nine",,,,,,,,,,,,
"percent of surveyed youth reported that they, themselves, were already parents (Sedlak and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"McPherson, 2010). Ninety percent of the incarcerated youth were found to have some type of",,,,,,,,,,,,
"emotional problem, and 71 percent had multiple emotional problems. A striking 20 percent",,,,,,,,,,,,
of surveyed males and 40 percent of females reported that they had previously attempted sui-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cide (Snyder and Sickmund, 2006). In addition, substance use history is much higher among",,,,,,,,,,,,
incarcerated youth than among other youth in the population. Among incarcerated youth in,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2003, 84 percent reported having used marijuana in their lifetimes, and 30 percent said they",,,,,,,,,,,,
had used cocaine or crack; the corresponding numbers among non-incarcerated youth were,,,,,,,,,,,,
"30 percent and 6 percent, respectively (Sedlak and McPherson, 2010).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Beyond these environmental and psychological risk factors, the problems facing juvenile",,,,,,,,,,,,
offenders are compounded by comparatively weak academic skills. The average reading abil-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ity of incarcerated youth has been estimated at the fourth-grade level, placing them five years",,,,,,,,,,,,
"behind average grade-level targets (Project READ, 1978). Though this estimate is widely cited,",,,,,,,,,,,,
it is based on data collected between 1976 and 1978; it is not clear how or whether the average,,,,,,,,,,,,
literacy skills of juvenile offenders have changed during the past three decades. Incarcerated,,,,,,,,,,,,
youth are also more likely than their counterparts to be learning disabled. In a 2003 synthesis,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of the research on youth with disabilities, Mears and Aron (2003) summarized evidence sug-",,,,,,,,,,,,
gesting that between 30 and 50 percent of incarcerated youth have special education disabili-,,,,,,,,,,,,

"mated that the proportion with emotional disabilities exceeded 50 percent, that as many as",,,,,,,,,,,,
"20 may have severe emotional disturbances, and that as many as 12 percent may be mentally",,,,,,,,,,,,
"retarded. However, they noted that reporting on these percentages is quite difficult, given that",,,,,,,,,,,,
screening procedures and diagnostic criteria are applied inconsistently across contexts and that,,,,,,,,,,,,
students’ disability records are not consistently transferred from their regular schools to their,,,,,,,,,,,,
correctional education programs. This is important because under the Individuals with Dis-,,,,,,,,,,,,

One important determinant of juvenile offenders’ prognosis appears to be incarceration,,,,,,,,,,,,
itself. A recent study examined ten years of administrative data from Chicago and capitalized,,,,,,,,,,,,
on plausibly random variation in juveniles’ appearance before judges inclined to assign incar-,,,,,,,,,,,,
the study found that juvenile incarceration reduced offenders’ high school completion rates,,,,,,,,,,,,
by 13 percentage points and increased their adult incarceration rates by 22 percentage points.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The authors suggested that expansion of less-restrictive penalties such as electronic monitoring,,,,,,,,,,,,
and home confinement may be an especially effective—as well as cost-effective—strategy for,,,,,,,,,,,,
reducing future criminality among juvenile offenders.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Purpose and Organization of the Chapter,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given that juveniles have the right to a publicly funded education, policymakers face the ques-",,,,,,,,,,,,
tion of how best to provide educational services that will lower young offenders’ risk of future,,,,,,,,,,,,
crime and increase their chance of success in the legitimate economy. This question is particu-,,,,,,,,,,,,
larly acute for offenders assigned to correctional facilities. Since incarcerated youth cannot take,,,,,,,,,,,,
"advantage of the public education systems available in their communities, correctional facilities",,,,,,,,,,,,
"must provide an alternative educational system to serve them. In educating juveniles, correc-",,,,,,,,,,,,

"We conclude the chapter with a broad summary of findings, a discussion of methodological",,,,,,,,,,,,
"limitations, and suggestions for research and policy.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Approach,,,,,,,,,,,,
A fundamental difference between correctional education for juvenile and adult populations is,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that juveniles in the United States have a right to a public education. Therefore, all programs",,,,,,,,,,,,
"for incarcerated youth include a correctional education component. In other words, the ques-",,,,,,,,,,,,
tion facing policymakers is not whether to provide education services for juveniles in correc-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tional facilities, but which types of programs are most effective. The meta-analytic approach",,,,,,,,,,,,
"in our adult analysis included many types of correctional education, each of which was com-",,,,,,,,,,,,
pared against a no-correctional-education scenario. A meta-analysis works best when you have,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a relatively homogeneous intervention (i.e., prison education) tested among many arenas and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"settings. For adults, we were able to conduct a meta-analysis by comparing individuals who",,,,,,,,,,,,
"received some form of correctional education to those who did not. However, that approach is",,,,,,,,,,,,
"less well suited to studying the effectiveness of juvenile correctional education programs, since",,,,,,,,,,,,
programs with an absence of correctional education are typically not present in the United,,,,,,,,,,,,
"States context on which our study is focused. Instead, our approach to synthesizing research",,,,,,,,,,,,
"on juvenile correctional education is to undertake a systematic review, in which we screen and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"evaluate articles using the same criteria as we employed in the adult meta-analysis. Yet, we now",,,,,,,,,,,,
summarize the findings of the research as a literature review rather than aggregating estimated,,,,,,,,,,,,
effect sizes across studies that are testing widely different hypotheses for the treatment versus,,,,,,,,,,,,
nontreatment groups. We focus on describing the balance of evidence favoring the types of,,,,,,,,,,,,
interventions examined in the literature we reviewed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Document Identification,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our comprehensive search for articles and reports pertaining to juvenile correctional educa-,,,,,,,,,,,,
tion was nearly identical to the search process we undertook for the adult meta-analysis. We,,,,,,,,,,,,
"employed  the  same  databases  in  our  search,  which  were  the  Education  Resources  Informa-",,,,,,,,,,,,

"studies conducted in the United States and released from 1980 through 2011. However, the",,,,,,,,,,,,
search terms we employed in this case were specific to correctional education for juveniles. Our,,,,,,,,,,,,
searches required one of the following descriptors from each set of terms:,,,,,,,,,,,,

We then supplemented this list with manuscripts cited by other literature reviews on the,,,,,,,,,,,,
"topic of juvenile education. Altogether, the document search process resulted in 1,150 citations",,,,,,,,,,,,
screening process.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eligibility Assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,
The documents collected through the database searches were then screened for eligibility by,,,,,,,,,,,,
two graduate students at the Pardee RAND Graduate School who had been trained in screen-,,,,,,,,,,,,
ing procedures for the project. The manuscript screening procedures were identical to those,,,,,,,,,,,,
"described for the adult meta-analysis report (Davis et al., 2013), except that for the juvenile",,,,,,,,,,,,
"intervention on incarcerated juveniles, where the definition of juveniles was permitted at that",,,,,,,,,,,,
stage to be defined by the manuscripts themselves or to include participants under age 21. As,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the adult meta-analysis, the manuscripts were also required to be primary, empirical studies",,,,,,,,,,,,
rather than literature reviews or opinion pieces. Each manuscript was screened independently,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by two screeners, and conflicts were resolved by a senior member of the research team. The",,,,,,,,,,,,
screening process yielded 157 manuscripts eligible for full-text screening.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The full-text screening process involved an independent review of the full manuscripts—,,,,,,,,,,,,
not just their titles and abstracts—by two graduate students. As was true for the adult meta-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"analysis, disagreements between the two screeners were resolved by a senior member of the",,,,,,,,,,,,
research team. To pass full-text screening and be deemed eligible for inclusion in the systematic,,,,,,,,,,,,
"review, the study was required to meet three criteria:",,,,,,,,,,,,
"26    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"who did not, or who received a different version of the intervention. The second type was a",,,,,,,,,,,,
"single-case design, which is a research approach discussed later in this section.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"For comparison-group designs, as in our adult meta-analysis, we rated the rigor of the",,,,,,,,,,,,
juvenile studies using two scales that closely correspond to one another—the Maryland Sci-,,,,,,,,,,,,
entific Methods Scale and the U.S. Department of Education’s What Works Clearinghouse,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(WWC) scale. On both, assessments of rigor reflect the extent to which the designs protect",,,,,,,,,,,,
"against selection bias, or unobserved differences between the treatment and comparison groups",,,,,,,,,,,,
that are correlated with the outcome of interest. Table 3.1 summarizes the standards employed,,,,,,,,,,,,
"types of designs, because randomizing the two groups renders the treatment and comparison",,,,,,,,,,,,
group alike in expectation. We assigned these designs a 5 (the highest rating) on the Mary-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"land Scale, and a “Meets Standards” rating on the WWC scale. Studies that demonstrate very",,,,,,,,,,,,
close matches between treatment and comparison groups on relevant observable characteris-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tics (at minimum, age, prior offenses, baseline education level, and time to data collection)",,,,,,,,,,,,
are awarded a 4 on the Maryland Scale and a “Meets Standards with Reservations” rating on,,,,,,,,,,,,
the WWC scale. Studies that do not demonstrate strong baseline matches (within a 20th of a,,,,,,,,,,,,
standard deviation for the aforementioned variables) but that attempt to control for observed,,,,,,,,,,,,
"baseline differences earn a 3 on the Maryland Scale, but “Does Not Meet Standards” on the",,,,,,,,,,,,
WWC scale. Studies that do not attempt to control for observed baseline differences between,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the treatment and comparison groups earn a 2 on the Maryland Scale, and do not meet WWC",,,,,,,,,,,,
standards. The Maryland Scale assigns a rating of 1 to studies that do not include a compari-,,,,,,,,,,,,

tualize findings from the eligible studies. We make mention of relevant level-1 studies because,,,,,,,,,,,,
these studies are often cited in the broader literature on what works in juvenile correctional,,,,,,,,,,,,
"education (e.g., Houchins et al., 2008; Wexler et al., 2013). Our aim in briefly mentioning",,,,,,,,,,,,
"education literature, while also highlighting why their designs do not warrant even limited",,,,,,,,,,,,
inferences about program impact.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We make one notable exception to the comparison-group requirement, and that is for",,,,,,,,,,,,
studies that use a class of approaches called single-case designs. Single-case designs are com-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"monly employed in special education research, where large samples are often unavailable for",,,,,,,,,,,,
"intervention evaluation (Kratochwill et al., 2010). They involve systematically introducing an",,,,,,,,,,,,
intervention with one or a few students in an effort to demonstrate causal effects on outcomes,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pre- and post-intervention outcome measurements, allowing students to function as their own",,,,,,,,,,,,
"controls. In this way, they do include a comparison condition, but the comparison condition is",,,,,,,,,,,,
the sustained pre-intervention state of the group that eventually receives treatment. Focusing,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on one or a handful of participants, these designs typically lack statistical power for conven-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"performance in the absence of the intervention, then clear deviations from that trend in the",,,,,,,,,,,,
presence of the intervention can be causally attributed to the intervention itself. The WWC has,,,,,,,,,,,,
therefore established specific standards for the rigor of single-case design studies (Kratochwill,,,,,,,,,,,,
"et al., 2010). We follow these standards when rating the single-case designs included in our sys-",,,,,,,,,,,,
tematic review. This means that we assign a level-5 rating on the Maryland Scale to studies that,,,,,,,,,,,,
"receive the highest rating (“Meets Standards”) under WWC standards for single-case designs,",,,,,,,,,,,,
because these studies demonstrate a strong basis for inferring that observe effects are causal.,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is consistent with our overall use of the Maryland Scale/WWC ratings as measures of,,,,,,,,,,,,
internal validity (freedom from selection bias) rather than external validity (generalizability to,,,,,,,,,,,,
"broader populations). Still, because single-case design studies are very small and do not permit",,,,,,,,,,,,
"hypothesis testing, we caveat our level-5 ratings for single-case design studies with asterisks in",,,,,,,,,,,,
Appendix Table A. This reflects the fact that the studies conform to a parallel set of internal,,,,,,,,,,,,
validity standards established by the WWC for these designs. We acknowledge that the ability,,,,,,,,,,,,
to generalize from such studies is limited by the very small samples they include.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Among the 157 studies eligible for full-text screening, nine could not be located. Another",,,,,,,,,,,,
"12 were duplicates. This resulted in 136 that received full-text screening, of which 27 were",,,,,,,,,,,,
deemed eligible for detailed review by our Scientific Review Team. Figure 3.1 illustrates the,,,,,,,,,,,,
"winnowing process, from the initial search through title-and-abstract screening and full-text",,,,,,,,,,,,
screening. It also summarizes the reasons for exclusion among the articles that received a full-,,,,,,,,,,,,
text screening.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scientific Review,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 27 studies that passed full-text screening were then reviewed independently by two Ph.D.-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"level researchers specifically trained in the data extraction protocol, as described in Chapter",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two of the meta-analytic report (Davis et al., 2013). The scientific review team for the juvenile",,,,,,,,,,,,

and with periodic norming feedback via email. The data extraction protocol for the juvenile,,,,,,,,,,,,

a question was added about the standalone or integrated nature of the correctional education,,,,,,,,,,,,

"score. For dichotomous outcomes such as diploma completion rates, employment rates, and",,,,,,,,,,,,

means that the attrition rates of the treatment and control groups fell below the more liberal,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distinctions from Other Reviews of Interventions for Juvenile Offenders,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our systematic review is intended to complement other reviews that have examined the evi-,,,,,,,,,,,,
dence on educational interventions for juvenile offenders. Lipsey (2009) has conducted a com-,,,,,,,,,,,,
prehensive meta-analysis on interventions designed to reduce juvenile delinquency. His study,,,,,,,,,,,,
"differed from ours, however, in that it included a wide array of interventions beyond education",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
comparable to our reporting for comparison-group studies.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"30    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
analysis to studies that focused on recidivism as the dependent variable of interest. Sander and,,,,,,,,,,,,
colleagues (2012) also examined the effects of a broad array of interventions for juvenile offend-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ers, including educational and non-educational interventions, and including studies conducted",,,,,,,,,,,,
"within and outside of correctional facilities, but they diverged from Lipsey in that they focused",,,,,,,,,,,,
"on academic rather than recidivism outcomes. In contrast to both of those studies, we limit our",,,,,,,,,,,,
review to studies of academic and vocational education/CTE interventions implemented with,,,,,,,,,,,,
juveniles incarcerated in correctional facilities.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Building on a small review of reading interventions in correctional settings by Krezmien,,,,,,,,,,,,

group who worked with a reading specialist. Whether this is due to the particular skills of that,,,,,,,,,,,,

"results should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, none of the observed effects, despite their",,,,,,,,,,,,
"large magnitude, was statistically significant, which is the result of the very small sample size",,,,,,,,,,,,
of nine students.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Houchins et al.’s (2008) randomized trial comparing Corrective Reading with smaller,,,,,,,,,,,,
versus larger instructional groups included 20 students ages 13–17 receiving instruction for,,,,,,,,,,,,
about 21 one-hour sessions. The findings for use of Corrective Reading in smaller groups (1:4,,,,,,,,,,,,

"tion, word attack, and silent reading (0.6, 0.5, and 0.7 of a standard deviation, respectively),",,,,,,,,,,,,
but were not statistically significant. (The word identification coefficient was reported to be,,,,,,,,,,,,

"tiple comparisons using the formula 1–(1–p)k, where p is the p-value, and k is the number of",,,,,,,,,,,,
comparisons.) The findings were positive but very small and statistically nonsignificant for oral,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reading at the third grade level, and negative but nonsignificant for oral reading at the fourth",,,,,,,,,,,,
and fifth grade levels. The size of the small Corrective Reading group in this particular evalu-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ation (four per group) appears similar to that in the aforementioned studies, based on the size",,,,,,,,,,,,
"of the treatment groups examined, which ranged from four to six across the studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Because Houchins et al.’s (2008) study was a rigorously designed randomized trial with,,,,,,,,,,,,
"low attrition, it merited a 5 on the Maryland Scale. Its results are therefore likely free from",,,,,,,,,,,,

Summary,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Taken  together,  the  preponderance  of  evidence  on  Corrective  Reading  in  correctional  set-",,,,,,,,,,,,

"comprehension comes only from the Scarlato and Asahara (2004) study, which merits only a 3",,,,,,,,,,,,

"Personalized learning is a broad term in the education literature, indicating that instruction is",,,,,,,,,,,,
adjusted to fit the unique needs and developmental trajectories of each student. The Bill and,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies with Ineligible (Level 1) Designs in Correctional Settings,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our examination of the research context includes two studies that were conducted in correc-,,,,,,,,,,,,
tional education settings that were not eligible for inclusion in the systematic review because,,,,,,,,,,,,
they did not include appropriate comparison groups. As with other relevant studies that we,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rated a 1 on the Maryland Scale, these ineligible studies appear in shaded rows in Table A.1.",,,,,,,,,,,,
The first of these is a very small study of personalized instruction within a juvenile cor-,,,,,,,,,,,,
rectional setting conducted by Muse (1998). The study was ineligible for the systematic review,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because it was based on student-level data only for the treatment group, and its comparison",,,,,,,,,,,,
"condition used aggregate, school-level data from four comparison schools. Given the lack of",,,,,,,,,,,,
"a same-level comparison group, we assign it a rating of 1 on the Maryland Scale. The study",,,,,,,,,,,,
focused on the GED completion rates in academic classes taught by the author in one North,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Carolina juvenile correctional facility (about 66 students in total), relative to the average com-",,,,,,,,,,,,
pletion rate of students at four other North Carolina juvenile correctional facility schools in the,,,,,,,,,,,,
state in the same years. Students in the study ranged in age from 12 to 17 years old. Examining,,,,,,,,,,,,
"GED completion rates over a three-year period, the author reported that 67.1 percent of his",,,,,,,,,,,,
"students earned GEDs, as compared with 8.0 percent of students in the other schools, though",,,,,,,,,,,,
"forth. Though the effect size is substantial, it is difficult to say how much of the 59.1 percent-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"age-point difference in completion rates was due to the intensive, personalized instructional",,,,,,,,,,,,
method as opposed to other factors. Results should therefore be viewed with great caution.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The other study of personalized instruction that was relevant to the research context but,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rated a 1 on the Maryland Scale was by Hill, Minifie, and Minifie (1984). They undertook a",,,,,,,,,,,,
program of diagnostic evaluation and personal tutoring as an 18-hour (nine-week) supplement,,,,,,,,,,,,
to traditional classroom instruction for 31 incarcerated juveniles in South Carolina who were,,,,,,,,,,,,
defined as handicapped. They found that students improved by about three months in silent,,,,,,,,,,,,

The largest and most rigorous of the studies was a randomized trial by the National Coun-,,,,,,,,,,,,

and aftercare upon release. The study was not able to disentangle the vocational and aftercare,,,,,,,,,,,,
"effects from the program’s personalized overall approach. However, because the randomized",,,,,,,,,,,,
"tion sample, meaning the study earned a level 5 on the Maryland Scale and a WWC “Meets",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Standards” rating. Despite randomization, however, the dosages of the treatment and control",,,,,,,,,,,,
"models were different; students in Avon Park were incarcerated for an average of 14.2 months,",,,,,,,,,,,,
versus an 11.2-month average for the comparison group. The study examined three different,,,,,,,,,,,,
"outcomes: rates of diploma completion at release, employment one year postrelease, and recidi-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"vism (defined here as rearrest) within a year after release. With regard to diploma completion,",,,,,,,,,,,,
it found a 26.9 percentage point higher rate among the treatment group relative to the control,,,,,,,,,,,,

The second study we identified as focusing on personalized instruction in a juvenile cor-,,,,,,,,,,,,
rectional facility was considerably smaller than the Avon Park study and did not use a random-,,,,,,,,,,,,

not  been  referred  to  RYEF  by  the  courts.  The  treatment  and  comparison  groups  consisted,,,,,,,,,,,,
only of students who successfully completed either the treatment or default program. Students,,,,,,,,,,,,

age length of stay for the control group was two months longer than for the treatment group.,,,,,,,,,,,,

made  for  observed  demographic  differences  between  treatment  and  comparison-group  stu-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dents. For these reasons, the study rates a level 2 on the Maryland Scale. The study found that",,,,,,,,,,,,
rates of rearrest or probation violation within six months after release were only 16 percent in,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the treatment group, versus 45 percent in the comparison group. Despite the small sample size,",,,,,,,,,,,,
this 29 percentage-point difference was large enough to be statistically significant (p < 0.05).,,,,,,,,,,,,
We  also  identified  two  studies  of  personalized  learning  that  focused  on  academic  test,,,,,,,,,,,,
to posttest gains on the California Achievement Test Total Battery for 68 incarcerated stu-,,,,,,,,,,,,
dents assigned to individualized instruction with the gains for 75 students assigned to group,,,,,,,,,,,,
"instruction. The total battery score included mathematics, reading, and language skills. In the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"individualized scenario, lessons and activities were tailored to students’ prior skill assessments;",,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the group approach, classes of about 12 students received daily instruction appropriate to",,,,,,,,,,,,
"gram showed nine months of academic growth on average, while those in the group program",,,,,,,,,,,,
"made seven months of growth, for a relative treatment effect of two months. Because effects",,,,,,,,,,,,
"accounted for the baseline performance of each student, the study merits a 3 on the Maryland",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scale. However, the study did not provide information for assessing the statistical significance",,,,,,,,,,,,
"of this difference, nor did it provide extensive information about other institutional and sample",,,,,,,,,,,,
"differences between groups. For these reasons, it is difficult to attribute the difference in gains",,,,,,,,,,,,
"to the individualized program itself, and the results must be interpreted with caution.",,,,,,,,,,,,
The  final  eligible  study  we  identified  that  focused  on  personalized  instruction  did  not,,,,,,,,,,,,

"conducted by Kane and Alley (1980), is relevant insofar as a peer-tutoring model may offer a",,,,,,,,,,,,
cost-effective alternative to a teacher-directed approach. Twenty-one students in the study were,,,,,,,,,,,,
"assigned to a peer-managed classroom, in which the ratio of peer tutors to students was 1:1 or",,,,,,,,,,,,
"1:2, and 17 were assigned to a teacher-managed classroom, in which the teacher-student ratio",,,,,,,,,,,,

"as compared with a mean of 6.0 for the students, and the curriculum was the SRA Computa-",,,,,,,,,,,,

"Park program employed in improving diploma completion and employment rates. However,",,,,,,,,,,,,
evidence for the effect of personalized and intensive learning on recidivism is mixed: The Avon,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Park study found no effect on rates of recidivism within a year, while the less rigorous RYEF",,,,,,,,,,,,

"Park study was 15 times as large as the RYEF study and that the latter used a less-rigorous,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"level-2 design, evidence of a positive relationship between intensive instruction and recidivism",,,,,,,,,,,,
reduction remains thin at best. One possibility is that some as-yet-undetermined threshold of,,,,,,,,,,,,
impact on skills or employment must be reached before such programs yield a reduction in,,,,,,,,,,,,
recidivism.12,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ever, our systematic review also uncovered two studies of remedial programs that did not fit",,,,,,,,,,,,
"directly into one of the aforementioned categories, and we consider evidence for those studies",,,,,,,,,,,,
in this section.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Studies with Ineligible (Level 1) Designs in Correctional Settings,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Interestingly, the number of studies of remedial education models that we deemed ineligible",,,,,,,,,,,,
for the systematic review but relevant to the research context—four—was twice the number of,,,,,,,,,,,,
studies in this category that were eligible for the systematic review. This is perhaps because our,,,,,,,,,,,,
“other remedial intervention” category acts as a catch-all for small studies that have examined,,,,,,,,,,,,
"various remediation efforts on a small scale, without the benefit of robust research designs.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"These four studies, which appear in shaded rows within Table A.1 due to their ineligibility, col-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"lectively examine the effects of teaching efforts for reading road signs (Murph and McCormick,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"1985), completing a job application (Heward, McCormick, and Joynes, 1980), using metacog-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"nitive learning strategies (Platt and Beech, 1994), and using three distinctive writing prompts",,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Sinatra, 1984). All are small studies, and all show gains in the target behaviors, but none uses",,,,,,,,,,,,
a comparison group. Because all four ineligible studies are included in the recent systematic,,,,,,,,,,,,
"review by Wexler et al. (2013), we consider them here in some detail.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Two of the studies focus on students with very low reading levels who have been clas-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sified, based on IQ testing, as having mild mental retardation. These two studies, by Murph",,,,,,,,,,,,
"and McCormick (1985) and Heward and colleagues (1980), use single-case designs and focus",,,,,,,,,,,,
"on improvement in fundamental, reading-related life skills—namely, reading nine road signs",,,,,,,,,,,,
in the former study and filling out an entry-level job application in the latter. The study by,,,,,,,,,,,,
Heward does not meet WWC single-case design evidence standards because it does not estab-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lish long enough baseline trends (i.e., with at least four or five observations per phase) before",,,,,,,,,,,,
"introducing the intervention, but it does show that students taught to fill out the applications",,,,,,,,,,,,
raised their average accuracy rate by 18 fill-in-the-blank items (out of 35) during 11 45-minute,,,,,,,,,,,,
instructional sessions. The study by Murph and McCormick does meet WWC standards in,,,,,,,,,,,,
"terms of the number and length of pre- and post-intervention phases, but it suffers from what",,,,,,,,,,,,
the  WWC  terms  an  over-alignment  of  instruction  and  assessment  (What  Works  Clearing-,,,,,,,,,,,,

"tion is clearly established, the measure of reading is simply too narrow to be construed as a",,,,,,,,,,,,
"measure of reading skill, and the intervention itself is also too narrow to generalize to other",,,,,,,,,,,,
contexts in which reading must be taught. Though the authors justify the reading of road signs,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as a necessary life skill for driving, it seems unlikely that 16-to-18-year-olds who struggle to",,,,,,,,,,,,
identify common road signs will be able to read and pass a written driving test—a fact that,,,,,,,,,,,,
undermines the authors’ assertion about the relevance of the task to their lives.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The two other studies deemed ineligible in this category also have serious design flaws.,,,,,,,,,,,,

"metacognitive learning strategies. However, they selectively present data for only five of the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"students taught by the 27 educators trained to use the method, noting that only the “most",,,,,,,,,,,,
"not presented, nor are any data presented about the number and demographics of the student",,,,,,,,,,,,
"sample. In other words, the data should be construed as anecdotal at best.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally,  Sinatra  (1984)  considers  the  effects  of  a  writing  intervention  implemented  in",,,,,,,,,,,,

"focused on visual, imagery, and report-writing tasks. He finds a noteworthy gain of 16 per-",,,,,,,,,,,,

Eligible Studies in Juvenile Correctional Settings,,,,,,,,,,,,
We  turn  now  to  two  studies  of  remedial  interventions  that  had  comparison  groups  and,,,,,,,,,,,,
were deemed eligible for the systematic review. Results from these studies are synthesized in,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Table 3.3 and are shown in greater detail in Table A.1. A study by Simpson, Swanson, and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kunkel  (1992)  examined  the  effects  of  a  structured  remedial  reading  program,  the  Orton/",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gillingham reading curriculum, as compared with the default language arts program in two",,,,,,,,,,,,
juvenile youth detention facilities. The Orton/Gillingham program was described in the article,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as phonics-based, with a focus on reading, writing, and spelling, and incorporating auditory,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"visual, and kinesthetic learning modes. Researchers identified 55 learning disabled students",,,,,,,,,,,,
"for treatment, 32 of whom persisted to analysis, and asked teachers to recommend a similar",,,,,,,,,,,,
"set of 61 students for the comparison group, 31 of whom persisted to analysis. The treatment",,,,,,,,,,,,
group received the Orton/Gillingham curriculum for 90 minutes a day in groups of 1–6; the,,,,,,,,,,,,
comparison group students received default language arts instruction for only 45 minutes a,,,,,,,,,,,,
"day in classes of about 12. Thus, the treatment group received a larger instructional dosage",,,,,,,,,,,,
"per week and in smaller classes. Treatment students may also have been released sooner, given",,,,,,,,,,,,
that their mean instructional hours were reported as 51.9 (about 35 days) versus 46.0 hours,,,,,,,,,,,,
(about 61 days) for the control group. Students in the analysis were tested at pretest and again,,,,,,,,,,,,
"before release using the Woodcock Johnson Test of Reading Mastery, and their rearrest rates",,,,,,,,,,,,
were tracked within the first year after release. Those in the treatment group gained 0.86 years,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of growth in reading more than the control group, and the difference was statistically signifi-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"cant (p = 0.007), though the treatment group also received a greater instructional dosage and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"in smaller classes. To eliminate the instructional dosage confound, the authors estimated that",,,,,,,,,,,,
the treatment group gained 0.38 years of growth more than the treatment group for every ten,,,,,,,,,,,,
"instructional hours, though they did not provide a hypothesis test for this estimate. Finally,",,,,,,,,,,,,
they found a substantial relationship between the treatment condition and recidivism avoid-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ance; those in the treatment group had a one-year rearrest rate of 41 percent, versus 63 percent",,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the comparison group, and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.015). Because",,,,,,,,,,,,
the treatment and comparison groups were both identified (at least by teachers) as learning dis-,,,,,,,,,,,,

abled and shared similar baseline reading scores (4.3 vs. 4.6) and ages of first arrest (13.7 and,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13.8), and because the reading analysis adjusts for baseline scores, we give the study a rating",,,,,,,,,,,,
"of 3  on the Maryland Scale. However, it does remain vulnerable  to unobserved  differences",,,,,,,,,,,,
"between groups. For instance, given that the treatment students appear to have been released",,,,,,,,,,,,
accounted for in the study.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The other eligible study of remedial education, by Archwamety and Katsiyannis (2000),",,,,,,,,,,,,
"focused only recidivism outcomes, measured between one and seven years after release. The",,,,,,,,,,,,
study compared 339 youth ages 12–18 enrolled in a mathematics or reading remedial program,,,,,,,,,,,,
(not both) while incarcerated to 166 students who were not enrolled in a remedial program.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Students who were assigned to remediation were at least one grade level behind at baseline in,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the remedial subject, and had a lower mean baseline IQ than their nonremediated peers (91.8",,,,,,,,,,,,
versus 99.3). The authors found that students assigned to remediation were actually 9.4 per-,,,,,,,,,,,,
centage points more likely to recidivate (definition unspecified) within 1–7 years after release.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their recidivism rate was 23.3 percent in the treatment group versus 13.9 percent in the com-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"parison group, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). However, the study",,,,,,,,,,,,
"did not adjust for baseline differences, resulting in a rating of 2 on the Maryland Scale. In",,,,,,,,,,,,
"other words, given that the treatment group clearly demonstrated higher baseline risk than the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"comparison group in terms of weaker academic and cognitive skills, the study does not provide",,,,,,,,,,,,
"convincing evidence that remediation caused higher recidivism among the treatment group,",,,,,,,,,,,,
and it would be inappropriate to draw conclusions about the impact of remediation based on,,,,,,,,,,,,
this study.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Summary,,,,,,,,,,,,
"between  remedial  education  and  recidivism.  Though  the  Simpson,  Swanson,  and  Kunkel",,,,,,,,,,,,
(1992) study of the Orton/Gillingham remedial curriculum was only about one-eighth the size,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of the Archwamety and Katsiyannis (2000) study, it showed stronger equivalence at baseline",,,,,,,,,,,,
and also provided clearer details about differences between the treatment and control condi-,,,,,,,,,,,,

sibility that treated students may have had shorter sentences or other unobserved differences,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that may at least partially explain the treatment effects, and thus the evidence supporting the",,,,,,,,,,,,
Orton/Gillingham program remains underdeveloped. Archwamety and Katsiyannis’s study is,,,,,,,,,,,,
highly vulnerable to selection bias and thus says little about the relationship between reme-,,,,,,,,,,,,
diation and recidivism. Beyond the evidence presented in previous sections about Corrective,,,,,,,,,,,,

settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vocational/Career Technical Education,,,,,,,,,,,,
Research Context,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Among the population of U.S. secondary school students at large, the prevalence of vocational",,,,,,,,,,,,
training—now commonly termed career technical education (CTE)—declined between 1982,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and 2004, with CTE credits accounting for 21 percent of the credits earned by high school",,,,,,,,,,,,
"48    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"graduates in 1982, versus only 14 percent in 2004 (U.S. Department of Education, 2013).13",,,,,,,,,,,,
"In part, this was a response to concerns that lower-achieving students were being tracked into",,,,,,,,,,,,
vocational pathways that did not prepare them to succeed in an increasingly competitive and,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dynamic labor market (U.S. Department of Education, 2013). Evidence on the effectiveness of",,,,,,,,,,,,
vocational education/CTE in raising academic outcomes is somewhat mixed. Using a nation-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ally representative sample of high school students tested in 10th and 12th grade, Bozick and",,,,,,,,,,,,
Dalton (2013) found no evidence that CTE course-taking improved or hurt students’ math-,,,,,,,,,,,,
ematics performance. Studies that have used lottery-based random assignment have also found,,,,,,,,,,,,
"little to no impact on test scores, though they have found benefits in terms of other outcomes.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example, Kemple and Willner (2008) randomized New York high school students to career",,,,,,,,,,,,
academies that provided both vocational and academic training in combination with intern-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ships; they found positive effects on high school persistence, as well as subsequent earnings",,,,,,,,,,,,
"benefits for males. Neild, Boccanfuso, and Byrnes (2013) capitalized on students’ lottery-based",,,,,,,,,,,,

"rates, though they performed no better than their peers on mathematics and reading assess-",,,,,,,,,,,,

likely to benefit from programs that emphasize vocational skills.,,,,,,,,,,,,
In a meta-analysis of 548 effect estimates from 361 studies focused on juvenile offend-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ers, Lipsey (2009) considered evidence about a variety of programs designed to reduce recidi-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"vism.  His  study,  which  included  studies  published  between  1958  and  2002,  differed  from",,,,,,,,,,,,
"vism as the sole outcome of interest, and only 22 percent of the estimates in his analysis were",,,,,,,,,,,,
based on programs administered within correctional facilities. Lipsey found that skill-building,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interventions—defined to include behavior management, cognitive-behavioral therapy, social",,,,,,,,,,,,
"skills training, challenge programs, academic training, and job-related interventions including",,,,,,,,,,,,
"vocational training—reduced subsequent recidivism by about 6 percentage points, though the",,,,,,,,,,,,
effect was not statistically significant at the 5 percent level. He also found that the effects of,,,,,,,,,,,,
skill-building interventions did not depend on the implementation context—whether in juve-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"effects by program subtype, he estimated that job-related training programs reduced recidi-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"vism by about 2.8 percentage points; however, this estimate was not statistically significant and",,,,,,,,,,,,
was smaller in magnitude than the 6 percentage-point estimate for the skill-building category,,,,,,,,,,,,
as a whole.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our own meta-analysis of adult correctional education also looked in particular at the,,,,,,,,,,,,
"effects of correctional vocational education/CTE for adults, finding that participation in voca-",,,,,,,,,,,,
tional  education/CTE  programs  while  incarcerated  reduced  adults’  odds  of  recidivism  by,,,,,,,,,,,,
"36 percent relative to no participation in correctional education (Davis et al., 2013).",,,,,,,,,,,,
Eligible Studies in Juvenile Correctional Settings,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the studies we are able to synthesize in this section, though CTE is the more-contemporary term.",,,,,,,,,,,,
a Systematic review of Correctional Education programs for Incarcerated Juveniles    49,,,,,,,,,,,,
Table A.1. Roos (2006) examined the employment and recidivism rates for participants of the,,,,,,,,,,,,
Re-Integration of Offenders–Youth (RIO-Y) career development course operated by the Texas,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Youth Commission. The sample included 1,502 incarcerated individuals ages 18–21, an age",,,,,,,,,,,,
group classified as juveniles within the program. Five hundred eight-two of these juveniles par-,,,,,,,,,,,,
ticipated in the 30-day RIO-Y program; another 920 received no career development course,,,,,,,,,,,,
or other instruction of note during that time period. (The RIO-Y study is unique in our sys-,,,,,,,,,,,,
tematic review in that the comparison group did not receive an alternative instructional pro-,,,,,,,,,,,,
gram during the intervention period. This is possible because all were 18 years of age or older.),,,,,,,,,,,,
"Students were not randomly assigned to the program, but the analysis adjusted for 17 baseline",,,,,,,,,,,,
"demographic and risk-related covariates, so it warrants a level 3 rating on the Maryland Scale.",,,,,,,,,,,,
The study reported that the odds of employment one year after release were 39 percent higher,,,,,,,,,,,,
"among the treatment than the comparison group, and the difference was statistically signifi-",,,,,,,,,,,,
cant (p < 0.01). This would correspond to about a 7.1 percentage point increase in the probabil-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ity of employment, using the 64.4 percent employment base rate one year postrelease reported",,,,,,,,,,,,
in the aforementioned National Council on Crime and Delinquency (2009) Avon Park study.,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Roos’s study does not report a base rate.) The study also found that the odds of rearrest within,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a year after release were 3 percent lower in the treatment group, but this very small effect did",,,,,,,,,,,,
"not approach statistical significance (p = 0.8), so the author concluded that the program had",,,,,,,,,,,,
affected employment but not recidivism.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wilson (1994) also investigated the effects of vocational education/CTE in a juvenile cor-,,,,,,,,,,,,
rectional facility. This study examined the rearrest rates within five years after release among,,,,,,,,,,,,
"403 juveniles, ages 11–18, incarcerated by the Colorado Division of Youth Services. Two hun-",,,,,,,,,,,,
dred sixty of the students participated in a vocational education/CTE training program while,,,,,,,,,,,,
"incarcerated, and 143 did not. The study did not provide details about program attributes or",,,,,,,,,,,,
"dosage levels. Assignment to treatment status was not random, and the analysis did not adjust",,,,,,,,,,,,
"for baseline differences, so the study merits a level 2 rating on the Maryland Scale. Bearing",,,,,,,,,,,,
"in mind that there was no adjustment for selection, the study found a statistically significant",,,,,,,,,,,,
"17.2 percentage point reduction in rearrest rates, from 78.3 percent in the comparison group to",,,,,,,,,,,,
61.2 percent in the treatment group (p < 0.05).,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally, DelliCarpini (2010) examined the effect of offering a new vocational education/",,,,,,,,,,,,
CTE program to youth ages 16–21 within a county jail in New York State. The new program,,,,,,,,,,,,
"augmented the existing academic instructional program with classes in business, drafting, and",,,,,,,,,,,,
carpentry. All youth incarcerated in the facility were enrolled in the program (though dosage,,,,,,,,,,,,
students were compared with outcomes for the prior-year cohort of 581 students. The rate at,,,,,,,,,,,,
which students earned a GED increased by 7.6 percentage points from 5.5 to 13.1 percent—a,,,,,,,,,,,,
statistically significant gain (p < 0.001). The gain was driven in part by an 8.2 percentage point,,,,,,,,,,,,
"increase in eligibility to test (from 7.1 to 15.3 percent), as determined by scores on a practice",,,,,,,,,,,,
"test, and also by an 8 percentage point increase in pass rates (from 78 to 86 percent) among",,,,,,,,,,,,
those who took the GED. The study rates a level 2 on the Maryland Scale because it did not,,,,,,,,,,,,
"adjust for (or report on) baseline differences between the two cohorts, and because it did not",,,,,,,,,,,,
adjust for secular time trends that may have accounted for differences in outcomes between,,,,,,,,,,,,
two sequential cohorts.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
Summary,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based  on  these  three  studies,  the  preponderance  of  evidence  for  vocational  education/CTE",,,,,,,,,,,,
in a juvenile correctional facility is positive for GED completion and postrelease employment,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and mixed for avoidance of recidivism. None of the studies are impervious to selection bias,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"but the Roos (2006) study does attempt to mitigate such bias through statistical controls, and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is also the largest study. Bearing that in mind, the positive evidence for employment effects",,,,,,,,,,,,
"seems firmer than for GED completion or recidivism effects. Still, the results from these stud-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ies are not sufficiently rigorous to be considered definitive. Taken as preliminary evidence, the",,,,,,,,,,,,
preponderance of extant research on vocational education/CTE in correctional settings does,,,,,,,,,,,,
"appear to support further study of such programs, preferably with rigorous methods that allow",,,,,,,,,,,,
for causal inferences about their effects.,,,,,,,,,,,,
GED Completion,,,,,,,,,,,,
Research Context,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two of the studies in our systematic review examine the relationship between earning a GED,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while  incarcerated  and  subsequent  recidivism.  Among  adult  incarcerated  populations,  our",,,,,,,,,,,,
meta-analysis found that completion of education while incarcerated reduced inmates’ odds,,,,,,,,,,,,
of recidivating by about 43 percent. Among the 22 studies (and 28 effect size estimates) that,,,,,,,,,,,,
"focused in particular on high school credential or GED programs in correctional facilities, the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"corresponding rate reduction in odds was about 30 percent (p < 0.05). However, these studies",,,,,,,,,,,,
pertain to the approximately 37 percent of adults in prisons who lack high school diplomas,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Crayton and Neusteter, 2008).14 In contrast, nearly all juveniles in correctional facilities lack",,,,,,,,,,,,
"diplomas because most are still of high school age. The question, then, among the studies in",,,,,,,,,,,,
"juvenile facilities that have focused on GED completion, is whether juveniles who earn a GED",,,,,,,,,,,,
while incarcerated are subsequently less likely to recidivate. The question is very difficult to,,,,,,,,,,,,
"answer in a causal sense—that is, does earning a GED reduce recidivism?—because juveniles",,,,,,,,,,,,
"remain in the facilities for very different lengths of time, and their ability to complete a GED",,,,,,,,,,,,
"academic preparedness, and their opportunities to pursue a traditional high school diploma",,,,,,,,,,,,
"instead of a GED. Unfortunately, these and other potential confounds are not fully captured",,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the studies we consider, and thus it is not appropriate to view the two studies, which rate at",,,,,,,,,,,,
"levels 2 and 3, respectively, on the Maryland Scale, as estimating the causal impact of the GED",,,,,,,,,,,,
"on recidivism. Still, the studies help to illuminate the association between GED completion",,,,,,,,,,,,
and postrelease recidivism.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The broader evidence on GED attainment is mixed with regard to educational and eco-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nomic outcomes. In the general population of high school dropouts, Heckman and Rubinstein",,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2001) found that earning a GED is negatively related to subsequent earnings, hourly wages,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"and levels of additional schooling, after controlling for cognitive ability as measured by the",,,,,,,,,,,,
Armed Forces Qualifying Test. They attributed this negative effect to lower levels of noncog-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nitive skills, such as persistence, planning, and adaptability, among those who earned GEDs",,,,,,,,,,,,
relative to other individuals who did not complete high school. This still raises the question,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of what the value of the GED credential is, holding all else constant, including motivation to",,,,,,,,,,,,
"pursue a GED. Tyler, Murnane, and Willett (2000) exploited between-state variation in GED",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"19 percent, according to the same report.",,,,,,,,,,,,
a Systematic review of Correctional Education programs for Incarcerated Juveniles    51,,,,,,,,,,,,
passing scores to separate the effects of the GED credential from the underlying ability and,,,,,,,,,,,,
motivation levels among high school dropouts who take the GED. They found that the GED,,,,,,,,,,,,
"credential itself improved white recipients’ earnings five years later by 10–19 percent, though it",,,,,,,,,,,,
appeared to have no effect on recipients from other racial/ethnic groups.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However,  the  aforementioned  studies  did  not  estimate  the  effects  of  GEDs  earned  in",,,,,,,,,,,,
"prison settings. In a rigorously executed follow-up study by Tyler and Kling (2007), the authors",,,,,,,,,,,,
"15 percent in the first two years after release, though this benefit was concentrated among non-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"white GED earners and dissipated after the second year. In addition, they found that most of",,,,,,,,,,,,
the benefit came from participating in a GED education program rather than from actually,,,,,,,,,,,,
earning the GED itself. The implication is that incarcerated individuals may benefit more from,,,,,,,,,,,,
the human capital they acquire by participating in a GED program than from the credential,,,,,,,,,,,,
"our own meta-analysis of adult correctional education, in which we found that participation in",,,,,,,,,,,,
an academic educational program while incarcerated increased the odds of postrelease employ-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ment by 8 percent, and that participating in a high school diploma or GED program, in par-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ticular, reduced the odds of recidivism by 30 percent (Davis et al., 2013).",,,,,,,,,,,,
Eligible Studies in Juvenile Correctional Settings,,,,,,,,,,,,
Given that all juveniles are expected to pursue a high school diploma or GED while incarcer-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ated, we did not identify studies that specifically examined the effects of GED program par-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ticipation (relative to no participation) for juvenile offenders. However, we did identify two",,,,,,,,,,,,
comparison-group studies that examined the effects of earning a GED while incarcerated in,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a juvenile correctional facility. We summarize our findings about these studies in Table 3.3,",,,,,,,,,,,,
and we provide additional details about each study in Table A.1. Unlike the aforementioned,,,,,,,,,,,,
"GED literature, which focused mainly on postrelease earnings, the two GED studies in our",,,,,,,,,,,,
systematic review examined the relationship between earning a GED in a juvenile facility and,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the probability of recidivating after release. The larger study, by Jeffords and McNitt (1993),",,,,,,,,,,,,
"examined reincarceration rates within a year after release among 1,717 juveniles ages 16–21",,,,,,,,,,,,
held in the Texas Youth Commission or Gulf Coast Trades Center correctional facilities in,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Texas. Among the 475 youth who earned GEDs while incarcerated, the estimated rate of rein-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"carceration was 5.8 percentage points lower than among the 1,242 youth who did not, though",,,,,,,,,,,,
the difference was significant at only the liberal 10-percent level. Though students were not,,,,,,,,,,,,
"randomized to their GED completion status, this estimate is based on a regression model that",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ous adjudications and incarcerations, and severity of most recent offense. For this reason, it",,,,,,,,,,,,
merits a level 3 on the Maryland Scale. The unadjusted difference without controls was 9 per-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"centage points (p < 0.1), which suggests that including the controls mitigated some selection",,,,,,,,,,,,
bias that exaggerated the GED effect.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The  second  study,  by  Katsiyannis  and  Archwamety  (1999),  examined  reincarceration",,,,,,,,,,,,
rates within three years after release among 549 youth who had been incarcerated for at least,,,,,,,,,,,,
four months in a Nebraska rehabilitation and treatment facility. Two-hundred eighty-four of,,,,,,,,,,,,
credential in motivating learning.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"52    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"the students completed GEDs while incarcerated, and 265 did not. The reincarceration rate",,,,,,,,,,,,
"among those who earned GEDs was 47.5 percent, versus 60.0 percent among those who did",,,,,,,,,,,,
also fits a logistic regression model with a subset of 260 students that controls for age at first,,,,,,,,,,,,
commitment and improvements in test scores. Though that analysis shows a positive and sig-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nificant effect, its sample restriction and inclusion of post-baseline controls lead us to use the",,,,,,,,,,,,
unadjusted rates instead. The comparison is rated a level 2 on the Maryland Scale.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Summary,,,,,,,,,,,,
The preponderance of evidence for earning a GED while incarcerated suggests that juveniles,,,,,,,,,,,,
who do so experience lower rates of reincarceration within one to three years after they are,,,,,,,,,,,,
released. This effect was estimated at 12.5 percentage points in the level-2 study by Katsiyannis,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and Archwamety (1999), but it was only 5.8 percentage points in the level-3 study by Jeffords",,,,,,,,,,,,
and McNitt (1993). Given that the Jeffords and McNitt study found larger effect in the unad-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"justed model, their more-rigorous estimate of 5.8 percentage points is likely a better true esti-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"mate of the GED benefit, and even that may be positively biased by selection on unobservable",,,,,,,,,,,,
characteristics. Because GED completion is at least partly a function of student motivation,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and aptitude rather than of differences in institutional programming, estimates of the impact",,,,,,,,,,,,
of GED completion are especially vulnerable to selection bias. A more convincing approach,,,,,,,,,,,,
while holding academic skills and other observable attributes constant. In the absence of more-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rigorous GED studies in juvenile correctional settings, we can conclude only that those who",,,,,,,,,,,,
succeed in earning a GED while incarcerated appear less likely to recidivate after release. The,,,,,,,,,,,,
extent to which obtaining the GED causes this difference remains an open question.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,
Limitations of Our Approach,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our systematic review of correctional education interventions for incarcerated juveniles reveals,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great heterogeneity in terms of interventions, methods, and outcomes of interest. Among the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"18 eligible studies we identified, we classified the interventions into six categories: Corrective",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Reading,  computer-assisted  instruction,  personalized  instruction,  other  remedial  education,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"packaged and branded reading interventions (Corrective Reading, Read 180, Fast ForWord,",,,,,,,,,,,,
and TiR) and focused on reading performance as the dependent variables of interest. Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the latter three categories focused on a broader set of outcomes, including not only read-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ing and mathematics performance but also measures such as diploma completion, postrelease",,,,,,,,,,,,
"employment, and postrelease recidivism. The wide variety of hypotheses tested in the studies,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"the broad array of outcomes examined, and the small number of studies in each hypothesis-",,,,,,,,,,,,
by-outcome category make it difficult to synthesize the findings into statements about the rela-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tive effectiveness of each approach. In fact, because the number of studies eligible for review is",,,,,,,,,,,,
"quite small, and because many of the studies are themselves very small in terms of sample sizes,",,,,,,,,,,,,
we mostly refrain from giving definitive pronouncements or ratings about the effectiveness of,,,,,,,,,,,,
"any particular type of intervention. Instead, we comment on the preponderance of evidence",,,,,,,,,,,,
"for each intervention category, based on the 16 comparison-group studies and the two well-",,,,,,,,,,,,
a Systematic review of Correctional Education programs for Incarcerated Juveniles    53,,,,,,,,,,,,
"executed single-case design studies featured in the evidence summary tables, Tables 3.2 and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.3. To contextualize those studies, we have also provided short descriptions of the broader",,,,,,,,,,,,
research context for each intervention type.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The effectiveness of any one of the intervention types in the study is likely to depend on,,,,,,,,,,,,
how well the program is implemented and for what period of time. Given the small number,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of studies in each category, we cannot easily extrapolate the effects of differential dosages or",,,,,,,,,,,,
"implementation approaches. However, the review does include a couple of exceptions. One of",,,,,,,,,,,,
the Corrective Reading studies was specifically designed to measure the effects of instructional,,,,,,,,,,,,
group size; it found a positive but statistically nonsignificant impact of smaller groups relative,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to larger groups that were using the Corrective Reading curriculum (Houchins et al., 2008).",,,,,,,,,,,,
And one of the studies of personalized instruction found a small but statistically nonsignificant,,,,,,,,,,,,
"negative effect of a peer-managed versus teacher-managed approach (Kane and Alley, 1980).",,,,,,,,,,,,
We are also unable to extrapolate differential effects by participant characteristics. The,,,,,,,,,,,,
"studies vary in the level of detail they provide about participant characteristics, and we lack",,,,,,,,,,,,
enough common studies testing the same hypothesis to examine differential effects by sub-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"group. Still, to facilitate policy decisionmaking among those using this review, we do report in",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Table A.1 on the demographic and baseline achievement features of the samples in each study,",,,,,,,,,,,,
insofar as that information was present in the source material.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Key Insights for the Research Community,,,,,,,,,,,,
We found that the methods employed in the studies varied markedly by intervention type.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Studies of the packaged reading interventions were generally fairly small, because these studies",,,,,,,,,,,,
"involve administering particular curricula at the classroom or student level, as well as adminis-",,,,,,,,,,,,
tering pre- and post-tests to individual students. Two of the Corrective Reading studies utilized,,,,,,,,,,,,
"single-case designs that involved just four and six students each, but even the two comparison-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"group studies included only nine and 20 students, respectively. The designs of these studies",,,,,,,,,,,,
"were fairly robust, with one level-5 randomized trial and two level-5 single-case designs, but",,,,,,,,,,,,
the small size of the studies and limited power for hypothesis testing still makes it difficult,,,,,,,,,,,,
"employed well-executed randomized trials, though the two studies varied in size. The Fast For-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Word randomized trial included only 51 students, again providing limited statistical power,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"but the Read 180 randomized trial was well powered, with 1,245 students; it was able to detect",,,,,,,,,,,,
a positive and statistically significant effect using a rigorous design that was fairly impervious,,,,,,,,,,,,
encouraged where possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The  two  studies  of  personalized  and  intensive  instructional  approaches  were  heteroge-,,,,,,,,,,,,
neous in size and design; the National Council on Crime and Delinquency’s Avon Park study,,,,,,,,,,,,
was a well-powered and well-executed randomized trial that included 714 youth and was able,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to examine diploma completion, employment, and recidivism-related outcomes, finding posi-",,,,,,,,,,,,
tive and statistically significant effects on the first two variables. The San Bernardino County,,,,,,,,,,,,
which may have in part accounted for the substantial recidivism reduction effect it uncovered.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The vocational education/CTE and GED studies were similar in that they took advan-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while incarcerated (vocational programs, or GED credential completion) to those who were",,,,,,,,,,,,
"not similarly exposed. In both categories, one study employed an array of statistical controls",,,,,,,,,,,,
"54    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"to adjust for observed differences between treatment and comparison groups, earning a level 3",,,,,,,,,,,,
rating on the Maryland Scale. The other studies in each category compared those exposed to,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those not exposed without adjusting for selection, and thus warranted a rating of 2. Compar-",,,,,,,,,,,,
ing the estimates of the level-3 and level-2 studies in the same intervention category and on a,,,,,,,,,,,,
"common outcome (namely, recidivism) suggests that selection bias may, indeed, have inflated",,,,,,,,,,,,
unobserved characteristics.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is also notable that none of the studies in the systematic review earned a level-4 rating,",,,,,,,,,,,,
which requires that the treatment and comparison groups be nearly identical on relevant base-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"line characteristics, as is sometime achieved by propensity score matching or other matching",,,,,,,,,,,,
"methods (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983; Shadish, Clark, and Steiner, 2008). Instead, the stud-",,,,,,,,,,,,
ies in the systematic review can be generally characterized as small-to-mid-scale randomized,,,,,,,,,,,,
trials or as large observational studies with minimum-to-moderate use of statistical methods to,,,,,,,,,,,,
adjust for unobserved differences.,,,,,,,,,,,,
This suggests that the field is ripe for larger-scale randomized trials. The Loadman et al.,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2011) Read 180 study and the National Council on Crime and Delinquency’s (2009) Avon,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Park study suggest that such studies, though challenging to undertake, are feasible. The lit-",,,,,,,,,,,,
erature is also ripe for rigorous evaluations of natural experiments such as Aizer and Doyle’s,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2013) study of the effects of juvenile incarceration using naturally occurring random assign-,,,,,,,,,,,,
ment to harsh judges. Studies that take advantage of rigorous causal methods in juvenile set-,,,,,,,,,,,,
randomized trials we include here have noted the difficulties of high student turnover in cor-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rectional facilities, and of simply gaining permission to undertake research in these facilities",,,,,,,,,,,,

"researchers and correctional facilities. Because such partnerships take time to establish, there",,,,,,,,,,,,
may also be a federal role in galvanizing them. The U.S. Department of Education Institute of,,,,,,,,,,,,

Key Insights for Policymakers and Practitioners,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taken in conjunction with the broader research literature on each of the interventions exam-,,,,,,,,,,,,
intervention administered at the Avon Park Academy (for diploma completion and postrelease,,,,,,,,,,,,
employment). Both of these interventions are supported by a large and rigorous study within,,,,,,,,,,,,
several large and well-executed studies outside of correctional facilities. Beyond these strong,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bodies of research, we find that evidence for Corrective Reading and TiR is positive but based",,,,,,,,,,,,
on very small studies from which it is difficult to generalize. Our review also highlights a few,,,,,,,,,,,,
"juvenile correctional education interventions, such as the Fast ForWord software program and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"peer-managed instruction, for which the current (though limited) body of knowledge offers",,,,,,,,,,,,
little support at the present time.,,,,,,,,,,,,
a Systematic review of Correctional Education programs for Incarcerated Juveniles    55,,,,,,,,,,,,
We  are  more  reluctant  to  offer  even  cautious  endorsement  for  interventions  in  which,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the strongest studies are rated 3 or below on the Maryland Scale, even if they show positive",,,,,,,,,,,,
"effects, as is the case with the Orton/Gillingham remedial education program. This limitation",,,,,,,,,,,,
in research quality also applies to the personalized interventions we reviewed other than Avon,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Park, the vocational education/CTE interventions, and GED completion as an intervention.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact, the benefits of earning a GED while incarcerated, though estimated as positive in",,,,,,,,,,,,
"the systematic review, remain especially unclear, since these studies’ comparisons of students",,,,,,,,,,,,
who earn a GED with those who do not are especially vulnerable to selection bias at the stu-,,,,,,,,,,,,
dent level. The most rigorous research from the literature on incarcerated adults suggest that,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is the education acquired in GED programs rather than the GED credential itself that con-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fers the greatest postrelease benefits (Tyler and Kling, 2007; Davis et al., 2013). This finding",,,,,,,,,,,,
is largely consistent with the GED research outside of correctional settings as well (Heckman,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and Rubinstein, 2001).",,,,,,,,,,,,
Though the evidence base about what works in juvenile correctional education remains,,,,,,,,,,,,
"programmatic investments. In the interim, program directors who make decisions based on",,,,,,,,,,,,
extant evidence can play a critical role in documenting their interventions and reporting on the,,,,,,,,,,,,
outcomes by using the most rigorous methods at their disposal.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When we began our correctional education study, we recognized early on that the 2008 reces-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"sion had a substantial effect on the field of correctional education, with many states reporting",,,,,,,,,,,,
cuts in funding for programs and changes to their delivery models for educating incarcerated,,,,,,,,,,,,
"adults, including such changes as shortening the length of time individuals spent in programs,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"reducing the number of teachers, reducing the number of program slots, and cutting some pro-",,,,,,,,,,,,
grams altogether. Such changes mean that today correctional education in the United States,,,,,,,,,,,,
likely looks very different from correctional education during the time that many of the studies,,,,,,,,,,,,
in our meta-analysis were undertaken. Understanding these differences helps us to put in con-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"58    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"vocational education/CTE programs for adults, and one focus group on juvenile correctional",,,,,,,,,,,,
education. The participants were recruited in advance using a purposive sampling design to,,,,,,,,,,,,
attain geographic representation and to include representatives from states considered to be,,,,,,,,,,,,
"leaders in field. A total of 30 individuals participated in these focus groups, which were con-",,,,,,,,,,,,
ducted at the 2011 Correctional Education Association Leadership Forum. The focus group,,,,,,,,,,,,
discussions identified several key themes facing the field. The purpose of these group discus-,,,,,,,,,,,,
sions was to help us identify some of the key trends in this field. During the focus group discus-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sions, we learned about a number of issues that were facing the field of correctional education,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"including the effects of budget cuts as a result of the 2008 recession, the need to gain efficien-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"cies in providing education to incarcerated adults and juveniles, the increasing role of computer",,,,,,,,,,,,
"technology in academic education and vocational education/CTE, and the challenges of the",,,,,,,,,,,,
new 2014 GED exam and computer-based testing. We leveraged the insights and information,,,,,,,,,,,,
at the Correctional Education Association and the U.S. Department of Education. The final,,,,,,,,,,,,
questionnaire was loaded into a web survey and fielded using RAND’s Multimode Interview-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ing Capability (MMIC) system, whose staff programmed and fielded the web survey.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Sample,,,,,,,,,,,,
The survey was distributed to the state correctional education directors in all 50 states. The,,,,,,,,,,,,
Education Association.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fielding the Survey,,,,,,,,,,,,
An advance letter from RAND accompanied by a letter by the BJA and the U.S. Department,,,,,,,,,,,,
of Education explaining the importance of the survey was sent to each director approximately,,,,,,,,,,,,
two weeks before the survey was fielded in July 2013. This was followed by an email invite to,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the directors to participate in the web survey, which provided them with the web link and their",,,,,,,,,,,,
"unique login name and password. In addition, we made available a PDF version of the web",,,,,,,,,,,,
survey for those directors that preferred to fill out a paper version of the survey or who asked,,,,,,,,,,,,
for a copy so they could see what information they would need to collect to complete the web,,,,,,,,,,,,
survey.,,,,,,,,,,,,
We sent several follow-up email reminders to those directors who had not yet completed,,,,,,,,,,,,
"or begun the web survey. In addition, the Director of the State Council of Directors, Cor-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"rectional Education Association, assisted us in sending out several reminders to their mem-",,,,,,,,,,,,
bership encouraging participation. Two team members also called individual directors whose,,,,,,,,,,,,
states that had not yet started or completed the web survey to encourage participation. Survey,,,,,,,,,,,,
responses were accepted through October 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Measures,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shaped by our discussions with correctional education leaders across the country, the survey",,,,,,,,,,,,
(see Appendix B for the questionnaire) included questions about the following topics:,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	 Preparations for the 2014 GED exam and computer-based testing,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	 Outcome and performance indicators tracked by states’ correctional education programs,,,,,,,,,,,,
•	 Budget and financing.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data Cleaning and Analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result of the various forms of outreach, data came to RAND in several different forms.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most data were received through the MMIC system, but respondents also sent emails or added",,,,,,,,,,,,
information in an open-ended comment field at the end of the survey to provide data on spe-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cific items or to otherwise clarify responses. Once the survey was closed, data cleaning involved",,,,,,,,,,,,
identifying the data provided through these methods and merging these with the final dataset.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because skip patterns were built directly into MMIC, the logic of responses that depend on",,,,,,,,,,,,
"earlier responses was maintained. However, respondents sometimes added information to the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"“other” category that could be coded as a previously listed response. In these cases, we recoded",,,,,,,,,,,,
responses for consistency.,,,,,,,,,,,,
We appended to the dataset information on the size of each state’s adult prison popula-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tion in 2009 and 2012 using data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (Carson and Sabol,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"2012; Carson and Golinelli, 2013). We undertook a descriptive analysis and present the results",,,,,,,,,,,,

tional education within states. Because this is a census of all state correctional education pro-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"grams, we do not calculate inferential statistics. Using data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics",,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Maruschak, 2012), we classified states by the size of their adult prison populations in 2012.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"We consider small states to have had an adult prison population in the range of 1–24,999,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"medium states to have had an adult prison population in the range of 25,000–49,999, and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"large states to have had 50,000 or more adult prisoners in 2012.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Results,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The overall response rate for the survey was 46 out of 50 states, or 92 percent, and impor-",,,,,,,,,,,,
tantly included at least partial participation from all of the states with large prison popula-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tions (n = 50,000 adult inmates or greater). In addition, 40 of the respondents (87 percent)",,,,,,,,,,,,
had responsibility for both academic education and vocational training for incarcerated adults,,,,,,,,,,,,
"within their state. Only five respondents were responsible for academic education only, and one",,,,,,,,,,,,
"respondent was responsible for vocational training only. Of the state directors who responded,",,,,,,,,,,,,
only four stopped before completing the entire questionnaire. The number of states on which,,,,,,,,,,,,
the findings are based is noted for each table and figure presented below.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overview of Correctional Education Programs Today,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For most responding states (36), the majority of correctional education program authority is",,,,,,,,,,,,
vested within one central state agency; it is shared among several state agencies in three states.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 30 of the states, the authority for correctional education programs resides primarily within",,,,,,,,,,,,
their states’ departments of corrections or public safety; only four states indicated that the pri-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mary authority was a state department of education or department of adult education, and one",,,,,,,,,,,,
respondent indicated that it resided within their state department of labor (data not shown).,,,,,,,,,,,,

Use of Technology and Preparedness for Implementation of the 2014 GED Exam,,,,,,,,,,,,
A growing trend in the field of education and in correctional education is the use of computer,,,,,,,,,,,,
technology. Gorgol and Sponsler (2011) surveyed 43 states on their postsecondary correctional,,,,,,,,,,,,
education  programs  and  concluded  that  correctional  educators  looked  to  technology  as  an,,,,,,,,,,,,
innovative way to improve the delivery of postsecondary education and to increase access.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Based  on  the  insights  from  the  focus  groups  we  conducted  and  discussions  with  key,,,,,,,,,,,
"experts, we included specific questions in our survey of state directors to gather data on what",,,,,,,,,,,,
"type of computer technology is currently being used for educating adult inmates, on instruc-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"tion methods that leverage technology, and the degree of access to the Internet by teachers and",,,,,,,,,,,,
inmate students. Forty-one states reported that at least one of their state’s prison facilities had,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a computer lab, with the median number of facilities with a computer lab being 11 (data not",,,,,,,,,,,,
shown).,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The use of computers in correctional education programs is common. Thirty-nine states,,,,,,,,,,,
"reported use of desktop computers (either standalone or networked), and 17 states reported",,,,,,,,,,,,
"use of laptops for their correctional education programs (Table 4.11). The use of tablets, such",,,,,,,,,,,,
"as Kindles or iPads, was reported by only two of the small states, and 13 states reported the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"use of other technology (specifically, eight states reported the use of smart boards). In terms",,,,,,,,,,,,

2014 GED Preparedness,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2014, a new GED assessment will be implemented. The new, more rigorous test will be",,,,,,,,,,,,
aligned  with  the  Common  Core  State  Standards  (CCSS)  and  will  use  a  new  test  delivery,,,,,,,,,,,,
model—computer-based  testing  to  replace  the  paper-and-pencil  examination.  These  two,,,,,,,,,,,,
changes have important implications for correctional administrators and educators in terms of,,,,,,,,,,,,
preparing for and implementing the new test. Educators will need to be prepared to teach the,,,,,,,,,,,,
CCSS and prepare students for a more rigorous GED test that will require students to demon-,,,,,,,,,,,,
strate high-level thinking skills and exhibit deeper levels of knowledge in four subject areas. In,,,,,,,,,,,,
"addition, the new test delivery model will require educators to prepare students to have a level",,,,,,,,,,,,
of computer literacy and skills necessary to successfully navigate the test using a computer.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These changes, in turn, have implications when it comes to agency budgets and professional",,,,,,,,,,,,
development needs of educators and present a number of logistical concerns when it comes to,,,,,,,,,,,,
preparing  to  implement  computer-based  testing.  We  asked  correctional  education  directors,,,,,,,,,,,,
about their preparations for the new GED exam and for their views regarding early concerns,,,,,,,,,,,,
about what these changes might mean for their correctional education systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thirty-one states reported that their state planned to implement the 2014 GED exam,",,,,,,,,,,,,
with nine states indicating that their state was exploring other high school equivalency exams,,,,,,,,,,,,
and two states indicating their state did not plan to implement the new GED exam (data not,,,,,,,,,,,,
shown).,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of those that planned to implement the 2014 GED exam, on average 14.5 of their state’s",,,,,,,,,,,,
correctional facilities (median was 11 facilities) were currently set up or were expected to be set,,,,,,,,,,,,
"up by January 1, 2014, to implement the exam (data not shown).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of those planning to implement the 2014 GED exam, 17 states planned to use a com-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"indicated that they planned to use only computer workstations, and two states planned to use",,,,,,,,,,,,
laptops only (data not shown).,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of the 31 states who planned to implement the 2014 GED exam, all but one indicated",,,,,,,,,,,,
that they would provide professional development training for their teachers and instructors to,,,,,,,,,,,,
prepare them to teach the new GED exam; the one exception indicated no such training would,,,,,,,,,,,,
be provided (data not shown). Table 4.14 summarizes the type of professional development,,,,,,,,,,,,
training states are providing or plan to provide to assist teachers and instructors in preparing,,,,,,,,,,,,
to teach and implement the 2014 GED exam and computer-based testing. Most states planned,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to conduct training on the testing process, test protocols, and test security requirements. Most",,,,,,,,,,,,
states also planned to train on instruction aligned with the common core standards and on,,,,,,,,,,,,
computer literacy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
State correctional education directors are concerned about the more rigorous 2014 GED,,,,,,,,,,,,
"exam and the implementation of computer-based testing. In our survey, 14 states expected that",,,,,,,,,,,,
these changes may have a negative effect on the number of adult inmates who will be prepared,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to take the new exam, 13 states expected a negative effect on the amount of time needed to",,,,,,,,,,,,
"prepare for the exam, and 16 states expected a negative effect on GED completion rates (data",,,,,,,,,,,,
not shown). Our findings are similar to that of a recent survey by the Association of State Cor-,,,,,,,,,,,,
rectional Administrators in which 21 states reported that they anticipated a sizable drop in,,,,,,,,,,,,
their pass rate for inmate students as a result of the switch to computer-based testing for the,,,,,,,,,,,,

Variation in Correctional Education Programming Across the States,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2013, most states offered adult basic education, GED courses, and vocational skills train-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ing. In addition, most states also reported having special education courses available. Higher-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"level educational programming, including adult secondary education and postsecondary edu-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"cation, is offered in about 70 percent of states (32 states and 33 states, respectively). However,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"we found that smaller states were less likely to offer such courses, suggesting that inmates in",,,,,,,,,,,,
smaller states have fewer opportunities for adult secondary and postsecondary education. In 24,,,,,,,,,,,,
"states, participation in correctional education programs is mandatory for adult inmates with-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"out a high school diploma or GED, and in 15 states mandatory for adults below a certain grade",,,,,,,,,,,,
"level. However, smaller states were less likely than medium-sized and large states to require",,,,,,,,,,,,
mandatory participation in correctional education programs. Smaller states though were more,,,,,,,,,,,,
likely to emphasize vocational education/CTE training for state prisoners than medium-sized,,,,,,,,,,,,
or large states.,,,,,,,,,,,,
An emerging trend is a growing emphasis on providing vocational education/CTE pro-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gramming that will lead to industry or nationally recognized certifications. For example, 28",,,,,,,,,,,,
states reported offering the National Center for Construction Education and Research certifi-,,,,,,,,,,,,
cation. Our survey suggests that more than half of reporting states offer certification training,,,,,,,,,,,,

"cation budgets between FYs 2009 and 2012. However, the effect of the recession differed by",,,,,,,,,,,,
size of state. The largest decrease in budgets was felt by medium-sized and large states. On aver-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"age, small states experienced a 2 percent increase in their state’s correctional education budget,",,,,,,,,,,,,
compared with a 20 percent and 10 percent decrease in medium and large states. Another way,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to look at this is to calculate the dollars spent per student during this time period. Overall, the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"mean dollars spent per student for correctional education was $3,479 in FY2009, compared",,,,,,,,,,,,
"with $3,370 in FY2012—a 5 percent decrease on average in the dollars spent per student.",,,,,,,,,,,,
The reductions in states’ correctional education budgets reportedly led to a dramatic con-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"traction in the capacity of academic education programs, and to a reduction in the number",,,,,,,,,,,,
"of  students  on  average  who  participated  in  these  programs.  For  academic  programs,  these",,,,,,,,,,,,
"budget cuts and resulting cost-cutting measures yielded, on average, a 4 percent decrease in the",,,,,,,,,,,,
mean number of adult students enrolled in academic programs between FYs 2009 and 2012.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Medium-sized and large states on average experienced a larger decrease in the number of adult,,,,,,,,,,,,
"students enrolled in academic programs (10 percent and 8 percent decrease, respectively) than",,,,,,,,,,,,
did small states who reported an average decrease of 1 percent in the number of students in,,,,,,,,,,,,
these programs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The effect of the staffing and capacity cost-cutting measures on teachers was particularly,,,,,,,,,,,,
"felt in medium-sized and large states. Overall, there was on average a 24 percent decrease in",,,,,,,,,,,,
"the number of academic teachers who were employees, from an average of 110 in 2009 to an",,,,,,,,,,,,
average of 85 in 2012. All size states experienced a decrease in the number of teachers who were,,,,,,,,,,,,
"78    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
(20 percent).,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition, 20 states also reduced the number of course offerings for academic programs",,,,,,,,,,,,
"during this time period; this was especially true in the larger states. In the short run, these",,,,,,,,,,,,
cuts saved states money by reducing the direct costs of correctional education programming.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, in the long run they may have added to the future costs of reincarceration, given that",,,,,,,,,,,,
inmates are now returning to local communities having had fewer educational opportunities,,,,,,,,,,,,
while incarcerated. Long-term costs are important to bear in mind. Our meta-analysis results,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with a 13-percentage point reduction in recidivism, and that for every dollar spent on correc-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"tional education programs, five dollars are saved in three-year reincarceration costs.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Vocational  education/CTE  programs  seem  to  have  fared  somewhat  better  during  the,,,,,,,,,,,,
recession than academic programs in terms of reductions in the number of students enrolled in,,,,,,,,,,,,
"vocational training programs, and in the number of instructors. On average, there was a 1 per-",,,,,,,,,,,,
cent increase in the number of students enrolled in vocational/CTE programs between 2009,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and 2012. However, this appears to be largely driven by an increase on average of 7 percent in",,,,,,,,,,,,
"smaller states. In comparison, the medium-sized and large states experienced a reduction on",,,,,,,,,,,,
"average of 4 percent and 11 percent, respectively, in the number of students enrolled in these",,,,,,,,,,,,
programs. Small and medium-sized states in fact saw a modest increase between FYs 2009,,,,,,,,,,,,
and 2012 in the mean number of vocational education/CTE instructors who were employees,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(8 percent and 24 percent, respectively). Combined, this suggests a modest expansion of voca-",,,,,,,,,,,,
tional education/CTE programs in small and medium-sized states during this time period.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Still, 38 percent of small states and 44 percent of medium-sized states reported that in response",,,,,,,,,,,,
to budget cuts they had reduced the number of course offerings for vocational education/CTE,,,,,,,,,,,,
programs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Use of Information Technology,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the major trends that will shape the future of work in the 21st century is the grow-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ing role of information technology in our society, with technological change resulting in an",,,,,,,,,,,,
"increased demand for a skilled workforce (Karoly, 2013). In today’s job market, basic computer",,,,,,,,,,,,
"skills are virtually a necessity in searching for job opportunities, applying online for jobs or",,,,,,,,,,,,
"benefits, and undertaking simple clerical tasks in the workplace. The importance of computing",,,,,,,,,,,,
skills for today’s job market is recognized by state correctional education directors and reflected,,,,,,,,,,,,
tional education/CTE programs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Further, distance learning and online instruction are growing trends in the United States,",,,,,,,,,,,,
with increasingly more educational courses being offered online by either colleges or virtual,,,,,,,,,,,,
high schools. These online courses are appealing in that they offer an opportunity to address,,,,,,,,,,,,
key barriers that correctional educators face in terms of limited classroom space and the need to,,,,,,,,,,,,
"scale back on instructional staff in recent years. In addition, the frequent movement of inmates",,,,,,,,,,,,
"opportunities, while distances between facilities (especially in rural states) make it difficult to",,,,,,,,,,,,
provide instruction in all facilities. Computer-assisted instruction is also appealing in offering,,,,,,,,,,,,
the opportunity to tailor instruction and coursework to the needs of the individual student.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet,  our  survey  results  indicate  that  the  role  of  computer  technology  in  correctional",,,,,,,,,,,,
education is complicated. We found that the use of computers for instructional purposes is,,,,,,,,,,,,

"worked) and 17 states reporting the use of laptops. However, access to the Internet, and the use",,,,,,,,,,,,
"of Internet-based instruction (one-way or interactive), is reported to be limited in most states’",,,,,,,,,,,,
correctional facilities. Thirty states reported that only teachers and instructors have access to,,,,,,,,,,,,
"live Internet technology. In 26 states, inmate students lack access to any Internet technology,",,,,,,,,,,,,
and in only 16 states do inmate students have access to simulated Internet programs. In focus,,,,,,,,,,,,
"group discussions, state correctional education directors cited corrections’ opposition to access",,,,,,,,,,,,
to computer or to the Internet as a key barrier to using technology in the classroom. In terms of,,,,,,,,,,,,
"instructional methods that use some type of technology, only ten states reported that they had",,,,,,,,,,,,
"closed-circuit television, and only a few states reported using it to provide one-way or interac-",,,,,,,,,,,,
tive video/satellite instruction.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Readiness for the 2014 GED Exam and Computer-Based Testing,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The GED is the predominant way that inmates earn their high school equivalency diplomas,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"and GED completion is often a prerequisite for many vocational training programs (Harlow,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"2003; Lockwood et al., 2013).",,,,,,,,,,,,
The new 2014 GED exam and the move to computer-based testing will further push cor-,,,,,,,,,,,,
rectional education systems to use information technology in the classroom and to find solu-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tions to some of these barriers. Of the 31 states planning to implement the 2014 GED exam, 17",,,,,,,,,,,,
plan to use a combination of computer workstations and laptops for inmates to take the exam.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The 2014 GED exam not only represents a more rigorous test, being aligned with the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Common Core State Standards (CSS), but also will rely on a new test delivery model—namely,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"computer-based testing to replace the old paper-and-pencil exam (Lockwood et al., 2013). This",,,,,,,,,,,,
GED completion rates are seen as important outcome indicator to track by 95 percent of states,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that took part in our survey. Of the 31 states planning to implement the 2014 GED exam, 14",,,,,,,,,,,,
states expected that the more rigorous GED exam and the use of computer-based testing may,,,,,,,,,,,,
have a negative effect on the number of adult inmates who will be prepared to take the new,,,,,,,,,,,,
"exam, and 16 states expected a negative effect on GED completion rates. This was particularly",,,,,,,,,,,,
true for the medium-sized and large states. Nineteen states were concerned about their teach-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ers being adequately prepared to teach the new exam, and 24 states were concerned about the",,,,,,,,,,,,
length of time it may take to prepare students for the more rigorous exam.,,,,,,,,,,,,
In recent discussions with state correctional education directors at a 2013 Correctional,,,,,,,,,,,,
Education Association conference and workshop we facilitated a discussion on preparations for,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 2014 GED exam. One of the issues the state directors debated was how to assess whether,,,,,,,,,,,,
an inmate student had sufficient computer skills to take the timed exam. Anecdotal reports,,,,,,,,,,,,
ing were that some inmate students did not have adequate computer skills to finish the test,,,,,,,,,,,,
"within the allocated amount of time. In addition to keyboarding tasks, the new GED exam",,,,,,,,,,,,
"and computer-based testing require a range of computing skills, such as knowledge of how to",,,,,,,,,,,,
"access tool bars, navigate “HOT SPOTS,” use “drag and drop” and “point and click” skills,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"and use a drop-down online calculator (Lockwood et al., 2013). The directors discussed pos-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"sible workarounds to help students, including the use of standalone calculators and having stu-",,,,,,,,,,,,
dents practice writing in long-hand their essays before typing their answers on the computer.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The directors also mentioned including as part of the GED preparation time in the computer,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lab for students. In our survey, 12 states reported concerns that limited access to computers",,,,,,,,,,,,
"80    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"may preclude some students from taking the new GED exam. Also, responding directors in",,,,,,,,,,,,
14 states reported concerns that their teachers may not be adequately prepared to implement,,,,,,,,,,,,
computer-based testing.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only two states reported no concerns about the new exam or computer-based testing.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In general, smaller states expressed fewer concerns; however, our survey results suggest that",,,,,,,,,,,,
"states with the majority of the prison population (i.e., medium-sized and large states) expect",,,,,,,,,,,,
to encounter a number of challenges in implementing the new exam and test delivery system.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given these concerns, the survey results suggest that the United States may experience",,,,,,,,,,,,
"a dramatic drop in the number of GED completion rates for incarcerated adults, which will",,,,,,,,,,,,
merit close monitoring and an assessment of the long-term implications for this population in,,,,,,,,,,,,
terms of effects on their opportunities to participate in vocational training programs and post-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"secondary education, as well as effect on employment opportunities. These results also suggest",,,,,,,,,,,,
that states may need technical assistance in preparing teachers and students for the new GED,,,,,,,,,,,,
exam. The fact that not all states will be using the GED exam as a high school equivalency,,,,,,,,,,,,
test raises questions about whether the use of alternative exams will be accepted by vocational,,,,,,,,,,,,
training programs and college programs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Postsecondary Education,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As noted earlier, the history of postsecondary education for incarcerated adults is one of an",,,,,,,,,,,,
initial growth in the number of programs and then a significant reduction in response to the,,,,,,,,,,,,
elimination of Pell grants in the 1990s for this population.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our survey results provide updated information about these trends. Our survey did not,,,,,,,,,,,,
ask about the number of inmates in postsecondary courses but does provide information on,,,,,,,,,,,,
the degree to which states offer them and how inmate students are paying for these courses. We,,,,,,,,,,,,
"found that in 2013, 32 states reported offering postsecondary education or college courses to",,,,,,,,,,,,
"adult inmates (especially true of medium-sized and larger states). However, these courses today",,,,,,,,,,,,
"are primarily paid for by the individual inmate or by family finances. In 16 states, state funding",,,,,,,,,,,,
"from the department of corrections, for example, is used to cover the costs of postsecondary",,,,,,,,,,,,
education. Only 12 states reported using college or university funds to pay for these courses.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our survey results suggest that reinstatement of the Pell grants for this population may have a,,,,,,,,,,,,
substantial effect in expanding postsecondary opportunities for state prisoners.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in providing postsecondary education",,,,,,,,,,,,
to inmates in state prison. Such programs as the Bard College Initiative and the Prison Uni-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"versity projects are two examples. Importantly, a group of foundations recently joined together",,,,,,,,,,,,
to fund a demonstration project in three states called Pathways from Prison to Postsecondary,,,,,,,,,,,,
Education led by the Vera Institute of Justice to support postsecondary education and degree,,,,,,,,,,,,
"these various initiatives are focused on degree attainment, whereas traditionally courses offered",,,,,,,,,,,,
within prisons often were not aimed at credential attainment or building a core of courses that,,,,,,,,,,,,
"would allow individuals to continue and, ultimately, obtain a postsecondary education degree",,,,,,,,,,,,
either while incarcerated or upon release from prison.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,
The key finding from this comprehensive study of correctional education in the United States,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that correctional education is effective in reducing recidivism for incarcerated adults and that,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is reasonable evidence that it is also effective, especially vocational training, in improv-",,,,,,,,,,,,
ing individuals’ likelihood of postrelease employment. Our cost analysis further showed that,,,,,,,,,,,,
correctional education is highly cost-effective for incarcerated adults—for every dollar spent,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on correctional education, five dollars are saved on three-year reincarceration costs. Our report",,,,,,,,,,,,
"correctional education for incarcerated juveniles. For example, we found compelling—if still",,,,,,,,,,,,
"preliminary—evidence  for  Scholastic’s  computer-enhanced  reading  intervention,  Read  180,",,,,,,,,,,,,
and for the highly intensive and personalized education model exemplified by Florida’s Avon,,,,,,,,,,,,
Park Youth Academy.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thus, the debate should no longer be about whether correctional education is effective or",,,,,,,,,,,,
"cost-effective; rather, the debate should focus on where the gaps in our knowledge are and oppor-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"82    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Throughout this project, at various conferences, workshops, and as part of individual dis-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"cussions with state correctional education directors, these directors have repeatedly said that",,,,,,,,,,,,
their legislature or department of corrections is asking them for evidence about how effective,,,,,,,,,,,,
their programs are to inform budget decisions and that they now are providing correctional,,,,,,,,,,,,
education programming with fewer dollars. The directors strongly desired information on how,,,,,,,,,,,,
the effectiveness of their programs. The results of our meta-analysis answers the first question,,,,,,,,,,,,
about  effectiveness—correctional  education  programs  are  dramatically  effective  in  reducing,,,,,,,,,,,,
"recidivism,  and  there  is  modest  evidence  of  improvements  in  postrelease  employment  out-",,,,,,,,,,,,
Conclusions and recommendations    83,,,,,,,,,,,,
exam is more rigorous than its predecessor and because of the new requirement of computer-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"based testing, the majority of state correctional education directors expect to see a negative",,,,,,,,,,,,
impact of the new GED exam on completion rates and on the number of inmates prepared to,,,,,,,,,,,,
take the new exam.,,,,,,,,,,,,
These directors also have expressed concern that lower GED completion rates will hurt,,,,,,,,,,,,
"educational and recidivism outcomes more broadly. However, existing research suggests that",,,,,,,,,,,,
this concern may be overstated because it appears that it is the skills inmates acquire while pre-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"paring for the GED, more than the credential itself, that reduces their postrelease recidivism",,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Tyler and Kling, 2007), and this finding is corroborated by broader evidence that the GED’s",,,,,,,,,,,,
"effect as a signal of worker quality is quite limited (Heckman and Rubenstein, 2001; Tyler,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Murnane, and Willett, 2000). Consistent with that conclusion, our own meta-analysis also",,,,,,,,,,,,
"found a positive impact of GED preparation, though it was not possible to disentangle prepa-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ration from completion in some of the less-rigorous studies (Davis et al., 2013). As such, it is",,,,,,,,,,,,
possible that a more-rigorous GED will actually improve the long-term outcomes of inmates,,,,,,,,,,,,
who pursue it. What is clear is that well-designed research is needed to estimate and docu-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ment the impact of the new GED on inmates’ educational skills, attainment, employment, and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"recidivism, as well as the implementation challenges it imposes on the correctional facilities",,,,,,,,,,,,
themselves. we recommend that the federal government monitor and evaluate the impact,,,,,,,,,,,,
of the new GeD and computer-based testing on the field and consider opportunities to,,,,,,,,,,,,
provide technical assistance to states and training to help prepare educators to teach the,,,,,,,,,,,,
more rigorous GeD exam and to implement computer-based testing.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The role of computer technology in correctional education is a growing trend, and the",,,,,,,,,,,,
new computer-based testing requirement for GED exam administration is likely to accelerate,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the adoption of computer technology in correctional settings. Given these changes, it will be",,,,,,,,,,,,
important to document how correctional settings overcome security and resource challenges,,,,,,,,,,,,
to computer-based testing and how they maintain their technology infrastructure in resource-,,,,,,,,,,,,
constrained  environments.  These  lessons  are  important  as  computer-enhanced  instruction,,,,,,,,,,,,
becomes increasingly commonplace in the broader secondary and postsecondary educational,,,,,,,,,,,,
landscape nationally. With the rise of blended learning technologies and massively open online,,,,,,,,,,,,
"courses (MOOCs), the question is not whether computers should play a substantial role in edu-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"cating incarcerated adults, but how best to facilitate their adoption and use. Further, educators",,,,,,,,,,,,
"need assistance in measuring readiness for the GED exam including computer literacy, as well",,,,,,,,,,,,
as assistance in adopting computer-aided instruction and incorporating online courses into the,,,,,,,,,,,,
"correctional education curriculum. In addition, there is a need for in-depth case studies and",,,,,,,,,,,,
evaluation of innovative examples of the use of computer technology in the classroom to aid,,,,,,,,,,,,
in identifying exemplary practices. An analysis of the larger literature on the use of computer,,,,,,,,,,,,
"technology in adult education may be informative here as well. Thus, we recommend further",,,,,,,,,,,,
evaluation and research on the use of computer technology in the correctional education,,,,,,,,,,,,
setting to help answer such questions.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"States are increasingly offering nationally and industry-recognized certificates, which is a",,,,,,,,,,,,
positive trend as corrections focuses increasingly on training programs that will lead to mean-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ingful credentials and enable individuals to earn a living wage. However, it is not yet clear to",,,,,,,,,,,,
"leaving prison, given the historically difficult time former inmates have getting hired in jobs",,,,,,,,,,,,
that provide a living wage—particularly in the sub-baccalaureate labor market. We need to,,,,,,,,,,,,
"assess the effectiveness of these programs, and the credentials they provide, in helping returning",,,,,,,,,,,,
"84    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
individuals find and sustain employment and to assess the degree to which existing barriers to,,,,,,,,,,,,
employment persist that may dampen the effects of having these changes in vocational training,,,,,,,,,,,,
"programs. Given the changes in the U.S. economy and the 21st century workforce needs, we",,,,,,,,,,,,
recommend an assessment at the federal and state levels about what such changes mean,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the criminal justice–involved population and that a summit at the state and federal,,,,,,,,,,,,
levels with private industry be supported to explore what opportunities are available to,,,,,,,,,,,,
formerly incarcerated individuals and what skills will be needed in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally, when we began this study, we conducted a wide search to identify what other",,,,,,,,,,,,
what was available tended to be out-of-date and limited in scope. The nationwide survey we,,,,,,,,,,,,
conducted of state correctional education directors can serve as a baseline moving forward.,,,,,,,,,,,,
repeating a nationwide survey of correctional education annually or biennially would,,,,,,,,,,,,
enable the field and policymakers to assess progress in specific areas and the impact of,,,,,,,,,,,,
different policies.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Correctional Education for Juveniles,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For juveniles, a key question is how best to provide services that will lower young offenders’",,,,,,,,,,,,
risk of future crime and increase their chance of success in the legitimate economy. In educat-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ing juveniles, correctional facilities must serve a highly transient population of students who",,,,,,,,,,,,
"bring a widely varied set of educational and emotional needs (Sedlak and McPherson, 2010;",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meisel et al., 1998; Leone, Meisel, and Drakeford, 2002). Further, youth with learning dis-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"abilities tend to be overrepresented in juvenile correctional facilities (Meisel et al., 1998). The",,,,,,,,,,,,
in the United States.,,,,,,,,,,,,
We focused our systematic review on education provided to juveniles in institutional set-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tings. Overall, the 18 studies in our systematic review can be generally characterized as small-",,,,,,,,,,,,
to-mid-scale randomized trials or as large observational studies with minimum-to-moderate,,,,,,,,,,,,
use of statistical methods to adjust for unobserved differences. We found that the methods,,,,,,,,,,,,
employed in the studies on juvenile correctional education varied markedly by intervention,,,,,,,,,,,,
"type. For example, studies of the packaged reading interventions were generally fairly small,",,,,,,,,,,,,
because these studies involve administering particular curricula at the classroom or student,,,,,,,,,,,,
"level, as well as administering pre- and post-tests to individual students. The designs of these",,,,,,,,,,,,
hypothesis testing makes it difficult to generalize broadly from their findings. This suggests,,,,,,,,,,,,
that the field is ripe for larger-scale randomized trials.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The field is also ripe for rigorous evaluations of natural experiments such as Aizer and,,,,,,,,,,,,
Doyle’s (2013) study of the effects of juvenile incarceration using naturally occurring random,,,,,,,,,,,,
assignment to harsh judges. Studies that take advantage of rigorous causal methods in juvenile,,,,,,,,,,,,
settings can shed much-needed light on what works in these settings. Several of the smaller,,,,,,,,,,,,
randomized trials we include here have noted the difficulties of high student turnover in cor-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ties (Shippen et al., 2012; Calderone et al., 2009). As such, we recommend that the focus",,,,,,,,,,,,
be on implementing larger-scale randomized trials and rigorous evaluations of natural,,,,,,,,,,,,
experiments. Such research efforts will clearly take time to develop and execute. They will,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conclusions and recommendations    85,,,,,,,,,,,,
ideally be realized through long-term partnerships between researchers and correctional facili-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ties. Informed by such partnerships, facilities can make increasingly evidence-based decisions",,,,,,,,,,,,
that not only improve their students’ prospects but also reduce the social incidence of crime,,,,,,,,,,,,
and delinquency.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taken in conjunction with the broader research literature on each of the interventions,,,,,,,,,,,,
"examined, we did identify two interventions that show particular promise: a blended learning",,,,,,,,,,,,
"reading curriculum by Scholastic called Read 180, which combines teacher-directed instruc-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"tion with computer-enhanced, self-paced instruction, and the Avon Park Youth Academy in",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Florida, which is a highly intensive program that includes personalized academic instruction",,,,,,,,,,,,
"given a markedly reduced caseload). Beyond these stronger studies, we found positive effects",,,,,,,,,,,,
"from very small studies of Corrective Reading and TUNEin to READING, but we think it is",,,,,,,,,,,,
premature to generalize from such small samples.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally, the benefits of earning a GED while incarcerated, though estimated as positive",,,,,,,,,,,,
dents who earned a GED with those who did not are particularly vulnerable to selection bias,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at the student level. Further, as noted above, the most rigorous research from the literature on",,,,,,,,,,,,
incarcerated adults suggests that it is the education acquired in GED programs rather than,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the GED credential itself that confers the greatest postrelease benefits (Tyler and Kling, 2007;",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Davis et al., 2013).",,,,,,,,,,,,
Improving the Evidence Base for Adult and Juvenile Correctional Education,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In our meta-analytic report (Davis et al., 2013), we laid out a number of recommendations to",,,,,,,,,,,,
improve the evidence base and they merit summarizing here. The questions we would like to,,,,,,,,,,,,
have answered were not feasible because of limitations in the quality of the evidence base and,,,,,,,,,,,,
the unevenness of the research designs used to assess the evidence and identify promising prac-,,,,,,,,,,,,
tices. There are four things that we recommend that the federal and state governments,,,,,,,,,,,,
and  philanthropy  invest  in  to  help  further  develop  the  evidence  base  for  correctional,,,,,,,,,,,,
education.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Apply Stronger Research Designs,,,,,,,,,,,,
Establishing a causal relationship between correctional education participation and success-,,,,,,,,,,,,
ful outcomes for inmates requires ruling out the possibility of selection bias. This form of bias,,,,,,,,,,,,
occurs when inmates who elect to participate in educational programs differ in unmeasured,,,,,,,,,,,,
ways from inmates who elect not to participate in educational programs. Isolating the effects,,,,,,,,,,,,
that can be directly attributable to a program is crucial in supporting the design of effective,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ble to selection bias. In our meta-analysis, only seven of the 50 studies used to assess recidi-",,,,,,,,,,,,
vism and one of the 18 studies used to assess employment were based on studies with high-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"quality research designs. Further, many studies did not report sufficient information about the",,,,,,,,,,,,
socio-demographic characteristics and other characteristics of the treatment and comparison,,,,,,,,,,,,
ences between the two groups to be evaluated and to quantify the potential threat of selection,,,,,,,,,,,,
"86    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"bias. To minimize this potential for bias, future studies should ideally use such research designs",,,,,,,,,,,,
as randomized controlled trials and well-executed quasi-experimental designs.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition, identifying the appropriate comparison groups is important. Many of the",,,,,,,,,,,,
studies reviewed in our meta-analyses used comparison groups of nonprogram participants but,,,,,,,,,,,,
"did not consider differences in terms of levels of education, certification, or training. Thus, the",,,,,,,,,,,,
comparison group might be a mixture of inmates with varying levels of academic achievement.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gaes (2008) recommended that a study registry be established to help sort out the dif-,,,,,,,,,,,,
ferent effect sizes found across studies. The vast array of programs currently administered and,,,,,,,,,,,,
the dearth of basic information on their design and their effectiveness in a centralized system,,,,,,,,,,,,
"preclude the effective utilization of resources, particularly for states making strategic decisions",,,,,,,,,,,,
on whether and how to recalibrate their programs to adjust to changes in funding and changes,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the prisoner population. Funding of such a registry by the federal government to be operated,,,,,,,,,,,,
by a university or research organization would help advance the evidence base by including,,,,,,,,,,,,
"details about each study, including information about the program and intervention, about the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"evaluation design, about characteristics of the treatment and comparison groups, and about the",,,,,,,,,,,,
outcome measures used. Such a registry could also provide technical assistance and evaluation,,,,,,,,,,,,
"guidance for those working in the field. Throughout the course of the project, we have received",,,,,,,,,,,,
repeated requests from correctional educators and researchers for this type of information—,,,,,,,,,,,,
clearly the field sees a real need for such a registry.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Measure Program Dosage,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many practitioners have posed the question: What dosage level is associated with effective cor-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rectional education programs? For instance, does it matter that an individual participates in",,,,,,,,,,,,
"20 hours of academic instruction, or is 30 hours of academic instruction required for a given",,,,,,,,,,,,
"course? Such questions about dosage levels are especially salient now, when many correctional",,,,,,,,,,,,
education programs have experienced significant budget cuts.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On average, the studies we reviewed lacked specific information about the dosage of the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"program, such as the overall program duration, the number and grade level of the courses in",,,,,,,,,,,,
"which inmates were enrolled, how many hours per day or week inmates were exposed to formal",,,,,,,,,,,,
"class instruction, and how many hours per day or week inmates worked on assignments out-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"side the classroom. In many of the studies, particularly those that were secondary analyses of",,,,,,,,,,,,
"administrative data sets, respondents were categorized simply as correctional education partici-",,,,,,,,,,,,
pants and nonparticipants. This crude categorization undoubtedly masked variation in expo-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure to the program among participants. For example, some inmates may have been enrolled",,,,,,,,,,,,
"for a year, while other inmates may have been enrolled for a week and withdrawn.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Without being able to discern such differences, it is difficult to put the findings from indi-",,,,,,,,,,,,
vidual studies in their proper contexts. The lack of dosage information means that there is little,,,,,,,,,,,,
to no empirical evidence that can help inform policymakers on “how much” correctional edu-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cation is necessary to produce a change in the desired outcomes. In future studies, the proper",,,,,,,,,,,,
recording  of  program  dosage  when  collecting  data  and  monitoring  the  progress  of  inmates,,,,,,,,,,,,
through correctional programs will be critical to enable researchers to examine these questions.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Identify Program Characteristics,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we undertook our review of the literature on academic and vocational training programs,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for incarcerated adults, our charge from BJA was to identify promising or evidence-based pro-",,,,,,,,,,,,
grams that could be potentially replicated in other settings. We were unable to identify specific,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conclusions and recommendations    87,,,,,,,,,,,,
"exemplary programs—not because such programs do not exist, but because the evidence base",,,,,,,,,,,,
Many of the studies in the literature review did not provide sufficient detail on the characteris-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tics of the program, such as the structure of the curriculum, the training and certifications of",,,,,,,,,,,,
"the teachers, the instructional methods used by the teachers, the student-teacher ratio in class-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"rooms, and supplemental access to textbooks and technology. To the extent possible, we culled",,,,,,,,,,,,
this information from the studies that provided it and used it in an exploratory fashion in our,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meta-analyses. However, few studies consistently listed these details in their program descrip-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"tions; consequently, our findings from these few studies are suggestive at best. Thus, from a",,,,,,,,,,,,
"meta-analytic approach, we are unable to offer evidence-based prescriptions about what aspects",,,,,,,,,,,,
of correctional education are most or least effective. The field would be well served if future,,,,,,,,,,,,
research carefully documented the characteristics of the programs so that different models of,,,,,,,,,,,,
program organization and instruction could be empirically validated.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Examine More-Proximal Indicators of Program Efficacy,,,,,,,,,,,,
More research is needed on more-proximal measures that would better indicate how programs,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actually affect thinking and behavior, such as changes in motivation, literacy gains, develop-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ment of concrete skills, or academic progress versus academic achievement. Overwhelmingly,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"the research conducted to date has looked at recidivism as the major outcome indicator, which",,,,,,,,,,,,
is understandable given its importance as a marker of successful prisoner rehabilitation. How-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ever, despite its salience in criminological research, the emphasis on recidivism has meant that",,,,,,,,,,,,
we know much less about the process through which correctional education helps shape how,,,,,,,,,,,,
former inmates re-integrate into the community. Correctional education is believed to improve,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the skills and abilities of inmates (i.e., “human capital” in economics parlance), which, in turn,",,,,,,,,,,,,
improves their chances of continuing education/training upon release and then finding gain-,,,,,,,,,,,,
ful employment. Only four studies in our review looked at skills and abilities (as measured,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by achievement test scores), and only 18 looked at employment. There were too few studies",,,,,,,,,,,,
of additional education/training to include in a meta-analysis. Applying these more-proximal,,,,,,,,,,,,
indicators of program efficacy will help to better elucidate the mechanisms that undergird the,,,,,,,,,,,,
role of education in the rehabilitation process.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In  summary,  to  improve  the  evidence  base,  state  and  federal  policymakers  and",,,,,,,,,,,,
foundations  should  invest  in  well-designed  evaluations  of  correctional  education  pro-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"grams. Also, researchers and program evaluators need to strive to implement rigorous research",,,,,,,,,,,,
designs to examine questions related to potential bias and program dosage. Funding grants,,,,,,,,,,,,
and guidelines can help further the field by requiring the use of more-rigorous research,,,,,,,,,,,,
designs. Funding mechanisms should also support partnerships between correctional educa-,,,,,,,,,,,,
tors and researchers and evaluators to undertake rigorous and comprehensive evaluations of,,,,,,,,,,,,
their programs. A study registry of correctional education evaluations would further aid,,,,,,,,,,,,
in developing the evidence base in this field to help inform policy and programmatic deci-,,,,,,,,,,,,

"88    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
Implications of Broader Trends in Corrections for Correctional Education,,,,,,,,,,,,
Several trends occurring in the field of adult and juvenile corrections have important implica-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tions that merit further consideration. First, a key trend in corrections is efforts by states to",,,,,,,,,,,,
"reduce the size of their state prison population, through a variety of means. This includes such",,,,,,,,,,,,
"“front-end” strategies as reducing prison admissions, diverting offenders to county- rather than",,,,,,,,,,,,
"state-level institutions, or changing felonies to misdemeanors. This approach is being tried in",,,,,,,,,,,,
"many states, particularly with respect to drug offenders. Delaware, for example, repealed man-",,,,,,,,,,,,
datory minimums for certain drug offenses in 2007. Colorado modified penalties for certain,,,,,,,,,,,,
drug possession offenses in 2010. New York’s Rockefeller Drug Laws were changed to elimi-,,,,,,,,,,,,
nate mandatory minimums for certain first- and second-offense offenders (Division of Crimi-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nal Justice Services, 2010). And Indiana proposed a sentencing reform plan to give judges more",,,,,,,,,,,,
leeway to sentence lesser felons to community corrections or treatment programs (Associated,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Press, 2010).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition, states have implemented strategies focused on the “back end” of the system,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"probationers and parolees. For example, in April 2011, California Assembly Bill 109 shifted",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Plan, which went into effect October 1, 2011, fundamentally changed the state’s criminal jus-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"tice system. Under Realignment, nonserious, nonviolent, and nonsex offenders no longer serve",,,,,,,,,,,,
"time in state prison, nor are they supervised by state parole when released (California Rehabili-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"tation Oversight Board, 2011). Instead, local counties are now responsible for managing, hous-",,,,,,,,,,,,
prison populations though accelerated release mechanisms. Media reports contained in Crime,,,,,,,,,,,,
and Justice News reports compiled by Ted Gest revealed that more than 30 states either are in,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the planning stages or have implemented policies for early release, some targeting large seg-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ments of the prison population, and others more narrow segments, such as the terminally ill.",,,,,,,,,,,,
All these changes in the correctional landscape have implications for how we think about how,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to provide academic and vocational education/CTE to incarcerated adults. For example, the",,,,,,,,,,,,
movement in some states to have low-level offenders serve their time in county jails versus state,,,,,,,,,,,,
prisons has implications for how we think about providing academic and vocational training to,,,,,,,,,,,,
academic and vocational education/CTE programs depending on the setting where one serves,,,,,,,,,,,,
one’s sentence? Are there differences in education and employment outcomes as a result?,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second, in the area of juvenile corrections, a related long-term trend has been to keep",,,,,,,,,,,,
"youth in the community if at all possible instead of placing them in correctional institutions,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"and, when they are incarcerated, to house them in local versus state facilities. A sharp decline",,,,,,,,,,,,
in the juvenile incarceration levels in the United States may partially reflect this trend. For,,,,,,,,,,,,
"example, the number of juveniles detained, diverted, or committed on any given day in the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"United States declined from 105,000 to 61,000 between 1997 and 2011. This suggests that",,,,,,,,,,,,
the current emphasis is on community-based educational services for juveniles who become,,,,,,,,,,,,
"involved in the criminal justice system, such as placement in nonresidential alternative schools.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Given evidence that incarceration itself reduces juvenile offenders’ educational attainment and,,,,,,,,,,,,
promising development.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conclusions and recommendations    89,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition, an important federal initiative to address the school-to-prison pipeline and",,,,,,,,,,,,
reduce at the front-end the chances of youth becoming involved with the justice system was,,,,,,,,,,,,
launched in 2011. The U.S. Departments of Justice and Education announced the joint Sup-,,,,,,,,,,,,
portive School Discipline Initiative (SSDI) aimed at addressing the disciplinary policies and,,,,,,,,,,,,
"practices that can push students out of school and into the justice system. As part of the SSDI,",,,,,,,,,,,,
the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education recently released a school discipline guidance,,,,,,,,,,,,
"package to assist states, districts, and schools in developing practices and strategies to enhance",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Department of Education, 2014).",,,,,,,,,,,,
Our  systematic  review  focused  on  what  works  with  incarcerated  youth  in  part  because,,,,,,,,,,,,
tional facilities is even more nebulous. An important direction for future research is to iden-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tify interventions that improve juveniles’ educational, employment, and recidivism outcomes",,,,,,,,,,,,
"studies on a large scale, it would of course be useful for longitudinal educational data systems",,,,,,,,,,,,
"to include indicators of students’ involvement in  the criminal  justice systems.  However, we",,,,,,,,,,,,
recognize that the inclusion of such indicators may raise both logistical and privacy concerns.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, any such indicators would likely need to be accompanied by rules governing their",,,,,,,,,,,,
"use (e.g., only for program evaluation in de-identified datasets). Without such indicators, it is",,,,,,,,,,,,
difficult to identify juvenile offenders in larger educational data systems and thus to conduct,,,,,,,,,,,,
large-scale analyses of what works for those populations outside of correctional facilities.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The growing policy emphasis on community-based schooling for juvenile offenders also,,,,,,,,,,,,
has implications for students’ transitions between correctional and noncorrectional settings. In,,,,,,,,,,,,
"our discussions with juvenile correctional education directors, they identified these transitions",,,,,,,,,,,,
as important challenges in terms of transferring academic records and maintaining curricular,,,,,,,,,,,,
consistency. The extent to which these challenges are mitigated by placing offenders in nonresi-,,,,,,,,,,,,
for facilitating smooth transitions.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To guide policy improvements, stronger federal reporting requirements about local cor-",,,,,,,,,,,,
juvenile offenders than about education for the larger K–12 population. Although some cor-,,,,,,,,,,,,
rectional education programs are included in the U.S. Department of Education’s Common,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Core of Data, inclusion is variable, and these programs are often difficult to isolate in fed-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"eral data. Moreover, such data provide little information about local policies on incarceration",,,,,,,,,,,,
"versus alternative placements and on standard sentence lengths, staffing policies, technology",,,,,,,,,,,,
"infrastructure, and instructional programs offered. A central repository of such information,",,,,,,,,,,,,
researchers alike.,,,,,,,,,,,,
we recommend that policymakers seek to assess and understand the implications,,,,,,,,,,,,
of these trends in the field of corrections with respect to their impact on correctional,,,,,,,,,,,,
education.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"90    How Effective Is Correctional Education, and Where Do We Go from Here?",,,,,,,,,,,,
Concluding Thoughts,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are more than 2 million incarcerated adults in the United States—more than any indus-,,,,,,,,,,,,
trialized nation. This study has demonstrated that education programs can help adults get back,,,,,,,,,,,,
on their feet upon release from prison and may help youth involved with the juvenile justice,,,,,,,,,,,,
"system to improve their education and employment prospects. Moreover, our meta-analysis of",,,,,,,,,,,,
the literature on incarcerated adults suggests that correctional education programs are highly,,,,,,,,,,,,
cost-effective in helping to reduce recidivism and improve postrelease employment outcomes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
States will continue to operate in a reduced funding environment for at least the near future.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The findings and recommendations we have laid out here are intended to ensure that, moving",,,,,,,,,,,,
achieving positive reentry outcomes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this appendix, we provide a detailed summary of the studies, sample sizes, and effect sizes",,,,,,,,,,,,
